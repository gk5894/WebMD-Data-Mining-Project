# WebMD-Data-Mining-Project

This project is a study of the Opoid drug market for chronic pain drugs. The data was obtained from the WebMD website using the beautifulsoup parser.
In order to duplicate the results just follow the scripts in the sequential order(numbered 1 to 5)

For the summary of the project please refer [report.md](https://github.com/gk5894/WebMD-Data-Mining-Project/blob/master/Report.md).

The detailed project [report](https://github.com/gk5894/WebMD-Data-Mining-Project/blob/master/Final%20Report%20-%20660.docx) extends upon the findings and contains all the necessary results and graphs.

#### Conclusion:
After performing the textual analysis (NLP) and doing some research, we concluded that WebMD website is not the ideal place to look for recommendations or reviews.
A lot of the reviews are subjective and hence it makes the outcomes very untrustworthy. 

We also found this article by  VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN from NYTimes to back our findings. Take a look.
