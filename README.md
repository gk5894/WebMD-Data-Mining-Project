# WebMD-Data-Mining-Project

This project is a study of the Non-Opoid drug market. The data was obtained from the WebMD website using the beautifulsoup parser.
In order to duplicate the results just follow the scripts in the sequential order(numbered 1 to 5)

The obtained results are in the [report.md](https://github.com/gk5894/WebMD-Data-Mining-Project/blob/master/Report.md).

#### Conclusion:
After performing the NLP analysis and doing some research, we concluded that WebMD website is not the ideal place to look for recommendations or reviews.
A lot of the reviews are subjective and hence it makes the outcomes very untrustworthy. 

We also found this article by  VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN from NYTimes to back our findings. Take a look.
