The white one is much less effective.  I have been told that different formulations by the generic mfg's can cause this for some people.

11,12, hernia dude| 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,2,4,1,Oxycodone.  And| my reaction to it. I had bilateral inguinal hernia surgery yesterday| June 21. All went well during the surgery and in recovery. Several hours later while resting at home| the soreness was getting to me. I decided to take one of the prescribed pills as the directions said take one or two every 4 hours for pain. I took it just before going to bed. And after perhaps 30 minutes had lapsed| I started to experience delusions of my body sinking into the bed| my body was sliding off the bed| thoughts of being suffocated|   and those were frightening enough  that I woke up Jane who assured me that no| you are falling through the bed. I was now awake when vivid images of extension ladders started dancing together and singing about bilateral hernias.  They were literally were swirling about the room in front of my eyes. Frequently|  I found myself staring at my raised arms while  my hands and fingers carried on incoherent sentences and conversations. At times while awake| the dimmed lights in the bedroom were dancing and I was carrying-on muttering conversations with myself. These awake experiences lasted for hours. They were not just uncomfortable and distressing| but frightening as well.  I have decided to not take another Oxycodone pill.        6/22/2017,OxyCodone,65-74,Male

14,15, mz1957| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,This drug is very effective in softening my low-level| but permanent groin pain. Hip replacement did not remove the pain.  The lowest dose (5mg) is all I need luckily| and over 2 years I have not needed to increase the dose. I take 3 or 4 times a day. It takes about 30 minutes to kick in| when I get a great feeling of relief from pain.  I was taking Percaset| which is mixed with Tylenol| but I was concerned about long term use of Tylenol| so I switched to straight Oxycodone| which is just as effective. It does not affect my mental functioning - maybe makes it better - I feel alert with full mental and physical functioning.  My work involves high level concentration and memory capabilty and it has not been impaired. My pain does impair my ability to work.|The only negative side effect is constipation| which I control with healthy| natural eating| with lots of fruit and yogurt.|I am concerned about the media coverage of the opiate epidemic. I am very aware of the addiction and overdoes risk| but responsible| non-addicts who get true relief with this drug| and who are functioning and productive| should not be caught up in the same net.|,OxyCodone,55-64,Male

49,50, Enduronman| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,5,5,I had tried everything else available. Once I was given this| I had immediate pain relief after 3 years of chronic pain. I have Relapsing Polychondritis| spondylosis| retrolisthesis| mixed connective tissue disease| auto immune disease| hernaiated disc (5)| and this medication was a blessing. However| your body does build up a tolerance to the prescribed dose and will need to be adjusted after about 4 or 5 months of use. I now take 20mg Oxycodone HCL| every 6 hours. What a real relief!

No I am not kidding. I am on SS Disability| living with my elderly parents. So I am very thankful that I can get some relief from all of the health problems that have attached themselves to me in the last 10 years or so. I can say that although I hate having to take ""Pain Medication"" one| b/c of the of people who have been abusing it| sometimes I have a hard time getting my Rx filled| and two| I hate the way the people who work in the Pharmacy sometimes treat me like I am a drug abuser.

Its a shame most Doctors| PA's| and ARNP's are afraid to write this drug due to the possibility of addiction. yes it is an addictive drug but you can also be slowly tapered from it.

72,73, Carrie1957| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,5,4,I used this medication after having my spinal cord decompressed. At first it relieved the pain. However after I started healing my nerves became more disrupted for me leaving me with a difficult time to stay asleep all night. I recently quit my gabapentin and I am backing off of my cyclobenzaprine| because right now nothing is taking away the pain. The nerve pain is very concentrated in my feet and my spine and neck. I have a lot of stiffness. The oxycodone works to get me going in the day and provides enough comfort to do ordinary daily tasks. I was on the oxy for 2 years straight after my spinal surgery. However MY Doctor (NURSE practitioner)does not want to supply me for policy reasons that I occasionally smoke marijuana for sleep relief. Our state is legal for marijuana. So this policy really crushes my spirit for proper treatment. I am not addicted to the oxy because it was easy for me to get off of it. However I have serious PAIN everyday and my quality of life is less than good. I don't think it is fair. I do not consume alcohol and I do not use any illegal drugs. I think it would benefit me to continue oxycodone because it did help resolve my pain issues to have a somewhat normal day.,OxyCodone,55-64,Female

This has been the only pain med to relieve the pain and have a halfway liveable life.  The only problem I have is that my pain management doctor will not prescribe it to me. He has tried me on all the newer opiod drugs such as Opana and Nucynta which give me little or no pain relief.  I know that doctors don't like to prescribe this drug to people but they don't hesitate to give you all these new opiods that are on the market.  I just want have some pain free days.

99,101, Dennis| 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,This is a great medication for the relief of chronic pain. It does not have the usual side effects of flu like systems |headaches or dry mouth. It has been my experience that the longer I have taken it | I could increase the time between dosages and very little problem with withdrawal when I stopped taking it . Also to me it did not upset my stomach or caused urination problems. One problem that I encountered when I first started the medication was blurred vision. That to me was the only problem that I had. Over the past five and a half years it is the only medication that can be taken for chronic to severe pain. I was involved in an auto accident in which I suffered major neck and back injuries and this is the only medication my pain management specialist found that would work safely. The reason for this is due to the fact that I have a heart problem that is critical and I can not be put under for corrective surgeries . They actually stated the medication helps the heart by increasing to some degree the veins and arteries that deliver the blood to and from the heart . They do however monitor my heart| kidneys and liver to make sure there is no onset damage.,OxyCodone,65-74,Male

Pain was unbearable with out it. Initially given as 2 Percocet (5/325 each)| then just Oxy alone. Works best for pain relief when combined with acetaminophen (ie Percocet). You can make the combo at home as long as you closly monitor the Acetaminophen intake. Tell/ask your doctor you are doing this. Oxy does give me sweats and chills and does make me tired. It also messes up short term memory. They are a small price to pay for the extreme pain I would be in otherwise. Always monitor this medicine w/a doctor and begin weening yourself off it as soon as you can tolerate the pain.

284,286, Starbull| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,5,4,I have severe pain from degenerative disc disease and have been using this medication for about 18 months. I take one 30 mg pill every 8 to 10 hours.  It does wonders to stop pain but I have experienced some side effects. My appetite is not what it used to be. The drug also causes severe constipation| which other drugs have not been able to correct. Sometimes I also have difficulty sleeping. If I am busy and forget to take my dose at the right time| my body will soon remind me.  Withdrawal symptoms come on quickly and can be very severe. Those symptoms are sweating| hot and cold flashes| and something I would describe as something like restless leg syndrome. My muscles get very twitchy.  After resuming my dose these symptoms disappear after half an hour and everything returns to normal. Overall I am very satisfied with this medication for it is the only thing that I have had prescribed to  me that actually relieves my pain| however I wouldn't recommend it unless no other type of pain medication will work. You will develop a dependance which will require slowly stepping down on the amount taken if you are to avoid suffering some rather severe withdrawal symptoms.,OxyCodone,55-64,Male

In response to several that have written wondering if their Dr can switch them to something else: all the effective pain killers are opiate based.

I already know| from previous conversations| that the DEA leans on him from time to time about his patients prescribed oxycodone.

Unfortunately| prolonged use will cause need for higher doses to relieve pain and when symptoms/pain becomes less| you will have to taper down the dose due to withdrawal type symptoms.

It really depends on the person| everyone is different. I think this is an overall good drug for pain. It has no Acetaminophen. I did use some ibuprofen for inflammation in conjunction with the pain medicine which helps way better than Tylenol.

This is one of the few drugs that can even come close to helping.  I would be dead without it but it cost so much I often suffer without it and those are dangerous times both mentally and phyisically for me.  Oxycodone has such a bad stiggma attatched to it because many people abuse it to get high but a true pain patients know they can't get rid of all their pain and don't cara about getting HIGH.  The junkies will find a way to get high one way or the other but those in severe chronic pain suffer in ways that 'normies' can't imagine when they don't have proper pain pills.  This one in the 30mg form works grat for both breakthrough and long term pain.  It does constipate so eat mango and it is useless for tooth pain but overall my quality of life is so much better when I take this medicine.  I have been out for two weeks waiting for someone to help me pay for my visit and script and I've wanted to off myself over the pain.  Nothing| legal or illegal| comes close to helping like my roxys and I try any and everything because my pain is sooo severe.,OxyCodone,35-44,Male

549,551, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,1,I have to agree with the review I just read about avoiding it at all cost. Yes| it takes away the pain| but it works in your brain by revving up your endorphines so that you feel no pain. Taking Oxy as prescribed (however not informed of the effects upon stopping) landed me in rehab. I was put at 5mg moved to 30mg and abruptly taken off once I was well. I have never used drugs of any kind recreationally| so to find myself in rehab after going off and in turn drug seeking was mind blowing. I had stopped eating| my heart was constantly racing| couldn't sleep| couldn't leave the house| I was literally pulling my hair out...until I managed to get it prescribed again. Two days after I got it filled| I had to admit that I had become addicted| worst part being| it was through no fault of my own. Apparantly| the doctor should've weaned me back down to 0| not drop it cold turkey. I will honestly say rehab| no rehab that going off this drug in any fashion is one of the worst physically painful and mentally/emotionally disturbing feelings one can ever encounter. It takes a long| long time to start making your own endorphines after this...so if you can avoid it do so| if not be closely monitered.,OxyCodone,25-34,Female
552,554, Corva| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have taken oxcodone er for almost 5 years. The only effect it has on me is to kill the pain! I take 40 mg three times a day. When you first start the medication it does have some side effects that are tollerable but when it is in your system on a constant dosage there are no effects. That was the best thing about this medicine. I didnt have the nasty side effects of vicodan or loritab. This medicine works well for me I dont abuse it and without it I would not have the quality of life I have now.  I suffer from fiboralga as well as a degenterative disk disease that effects my joints. Before this medicine I had uncontrolable pain that was effecting my blood preasure. Iam very thankful for this medicine. It saddens me to hear of people who abuse this medication. Due to the effect that it makes it hard for people who need the relief have a hard time getting a dr to help them!,OxyCodone,35-44,Female

555,557, eaglemom59| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,5,5,Began on 5mg IR a few months back after 3.5 years of Lortab 7.5. I have DDD| ruptured disk with scar tissue around the sciatic nerve at L5S1. Prior Microdiscectomy 2 years ago. This drug works better for my pain| but doesn't last as long. I also had Fibro with major muscle cramping. I take 3 different muscle relaxers| Voltaren and Klonopin daily. I can get pain free to go to sleep but If I do not redose with one or two at about 4 am and just wait until am| I feel like hit with Mack truck. Flu like symptoms| runny nose| watery eyes. Bingo| just like withdrawel. All of those years on Lortab and I could go day without. Wasn't comfortable but now I definetley have an dependance. The IR's can be chewed or dissolved under tongue for faster relief. I need somthing for the breakthrough pain and geez I'm already taking so much. I have no idea what comes next. Having radical discectomy soon| hoping the sciatica will calm down| but the DDD will never go away. Also 3 ruptured disks in neck but nerve studies say I don't need surgery there yet. Chronic pain is hard to live with| this drug helps but isn't the best in my opinion. I'd like something laonger lasting. Any ideas what comes after these?,OxyCodone,45-54,Female

559,561, bulldozer| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,5,4,I've found that the 15mg's give me a headache approx. 1.5 hours after a dose. I've taken hydro 10/325's since '03 without the headache issue| so I'm not sure why the oxy's do this. Other than that| they work fairly well for my neck and back pain| but don't seem to be as effective with my TMJ/ear pain/headache pain. I have noticed my muscle relaxer's actually work better with the oxy's than the hydro's| which is a bonus since I have severe spasms. They are addictive and cause constipation| but all pain meds (THAT WORK| and some that don't work -tramadol-) have those side affects. I just wish the oxy 15's wouldn't give me the headaches. The LAST thing I need is the medication I'm taking to relieve pain giving me more pain. After so many years on hydro's though| they're just not working anymore. I doubt I'll ever be off pain meds| but I'm worried about tolerance to oxy building up quicker than it does to hydro's. What's after that? Morphine? Methadone? I'm not ready to go there just yet.,OxyCodone,35-44,Female

Has anyone found this to be true?  What I mean is by the 5th day| I required more medication because the original dose did not cover my pain.  Anyone?,OxyCodone,45-54,Female

I will be in pain for the rest of my life! One serios WARNING! Do not make the mistake that I made by thinking I could just stop taking this medicine all at once! I did this after my 1st 6 months of taking it everyday. I didn't like my doctor and thought I didn't need either one. OMG! I went into the worst withdrawls! I was violently vomiting| shaking| had severe panic attacks| muscle spasms| the chills- burning up and sweating| could not sleep for days|it was like the flu x a million mixed with anxiety and panic!  My doctor had just left for his 3rd two week vacation in 6 months! I was scared I was dying|so insted of looking for another Dr.|I ended up going to the emergency room| and was immediately seen by a so called mental health expert who said I was a drug addict and the next thing I knew|the police were there guarding my room until an ambulance came and took me against my will to a mental/drug rehab center! The hospital never tried to contact my doctors office or verify that I had been prescribed the med! They gave me shots of subutex for my withdrawls| which made them ease up| but I could not nor could my family get me out of the hospital for 7 days! That's what happens when you make the mistake of going to the emergency room for withdrawls| never do it! Try to find another pain specialist and tell them what happened. Just a warning| even if you do not get MENTALLY addicted|you WILL get PSYCIALLY addicted! DO NOT STOP TAKING THIS OR ANY OTHER MED. YOU TAKE ON A DAILY BASIS-WITHOUT TALKING TO YOUR DOCTOR FIRST! You WILL get violently ill|there is no way around it! If you can't find a doctor|go to the E.R.You could actually die from dehydration/other complications.

However| the worst pain involves my neck and lower back. I take Morphine Sulfate (ER) 160 mg 3 times per day and Oxycodone hcl 30 mg as needed for breakthrough pain. I know that medications affect each one of us differently to a certain degree. But| for me| I've never suffered any adverse effects from the pain medications| except for constipation| and that is easily alleviated with another medication. My pain is well-controlled by these medications such that I rarely exceed a 2 on the pain scale. However| if I feel an episode of breakthrough pain coming on| I immediately take a dose of Oxycodone hcl. I don't wait. In the past| when I've waited to see how bad the pain would get| I've quickly reached a 7 to 8 on the pain scale and then had to fight (take the Oxycodone hcl at the prescribed dose for 2 to 3 doses back-to-back) to get the pain level back to where it was tolerable. This doesn't happen| if I don't wait. I've had an ""adult long-rod procedure"" recommended to attempt to fix one of my sources of pain| but I want to avoid that at all costs. I have 3 friends| who have been partially or totally paralyzed from the lower back on down from back surgery or from infections resulting from back surgery| and I'm too scared to have it done| especially with the relief I get from medication.

Much to my surprise| my pain has continued well beyond the amputation (why it is called ""phantom"" pain is beyond me.. its like having my sciatic nerve pinched by pliers with huge volts of electricity.)  My doctor prescribed a Fentanyl patch in the beginning then weaned me off that onto oral Oxycontin (eventually at 3x10 mg a day). I changed insurers and was told I had to take the ""generic"" version of the Oxycontin called ""Oxycodone"" if I wanted it covered by my insurance. I found I had to increase my dosage when I switched and this worried me| but could not afford to pay the full price of Oxycontin. I seemed to  find my pain relief at about 50 mg a day of Oxycodone. I'd say relief was better than the brand name version. The last time I went to my pharmacy to pick up my prescription I noticed they gave me Oxycontin (this is after a year of being on the Oxycodone.) I asked why? since it was originally not covered by me insurance? My pharmacist told me they took Oxycodone off the market because of the abuse by people using it recreationally. I also found out they changed the way the Oxycontin is formulated to prevent abuse. I made the change and experienced severe nausea and vomiting for almost 2 weeks. I am finally adjusted back to the Oxycontin| but really don't understand why the people that really need these meds have to be put on a roller coaster because of the recreational abusers.",OxyCodone,45-54,Female

In the state of Fl| there has been much conflict about the availability of this med| in the interest of the politics and the sheriff's office promoting it's sacrosanct views.  For myself| the difference has been positive as a whole| I am not a dependent of the state| I work full time and while on my med| I am a productive member of society.  Unexpectedly and rarely mentioned| I have also noticed an absence of my depressive symptoms| insomnia is gone and I do very well at work as well.  Gone are the nagging self doubts (important in sales)| my energy level is up and my mental alertness is optimal.  Without| my absences increase| energy level is low and depression returns. I believe this med should seriously be considered in the treatment of depression.  Addiction is less of a concern to me than living a full productive life| as it should be.

1045,1048, DreamAngel629| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have been on Oxycodone for almost 4 years now.  I take this medicine for break-through pain and I am also on Opana ER| which is a time-release medication for severe pain.  Six years ago I feel and tore my 3 lower discs and have RSD down my left arm and severe pain| numbness| swelling and many other symptoms in my left leg.  This medication has been a miracle for me.  After 2 years of my accident| the doctor I was seeing said that he could no longer do anything for me but a friend of mine referred me to a Pain Management doctor.  This man saved my life.  I was suffering from severe pain| depression and anger.  It took some time to get used to the medications| but once I did| I seemed to have some form of my life back.  In the morning| I can not get out of bed with out taking 2 30mg Oxycodone| which I am only supposed to take 1| but 2 helps me function better.  Then I take my Opana ER 3 - 40mg and 1 - 20mg in the a.m. and then the same amount 12 hours later.  This is a very high does of medication I am on| but without it| I am in so much pain| which right not there is no other course of treatment for nerve damage| that I have thought of taking my life.  Before this happened| I was such an active person| with a husband| 2 small children and an elderly mother who all depended on me.  I felt totally useless| but this medication has brought me back to life.  I know that someday I may have to come off and I am not looking forward to that because working in the medical field years ago| I know what withdrawl can be like.  But as long as I can function and deal with the pain| I will stay on this as long as the doctor agrees.  Yes| I still have pain| which will never completly go away| but with his medication and can still be an active member of society.  Thank you to my doctor and the drug companies for making this medication.  But please do some more research on how to cure RSD and other types of nerve damage.  I know I am not alone and we need your help.  Thank you.,OxyCodone,45-54,Female

When I asked to have the pump removed| my doctor indicated that I would probably commit suicide.  Well| here it is 5 years later and I'M STILL HERE.  I give much of the credit to the the regular schedule of the Oxycodone.  If I wait until the pain is strong| the medicine does not work as well.  I do not consider myself an addict as I never take more than my doctor has prescribed.  I will say that as time progresses I worry about liver problems and the fact that I might need stronger doses| which will cause more problems.

1108,1112, zoe| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,3,5,3,I have been on Percocet and Vicodin since 2005.  They worked great in the beginning but as with most narcs you build up a tolerence and you need mor and more to get relief.  Currently I take 10/325mg Percocet and 10/500mg Vicodin on a PRN basis.  I get 60 Perocet and 45 Vicodin each month and I run out almost every month and in terrible pain when I do.  I obviously have a dependency on them but have no other way to live a half way normal life.  I have had countless surgeries over the last few years and another drawback is that the pain after that is unbearable.  Morphine and other drugs in that classification do not give much relief either.  My advice to anyone starting to take these is to take as low of a dose for as long as possible before and to FOLLOW the directions because if you don't nothing works later.,OxyCodone,35-44,Female

I was involved in a flgiht for life trauma 8 years ago and been fighting to regain my life ever since. The docs put me on high doses of both long acting Oxycontin to short acting percocet and then would bring me down to a level post-op to settle my chronic pain levels down. The only problem is that the narcs make me feel too good and ended up putting me in rehab as I would go through a thirty day supply in a week to ten days. The withdrawal sets in and that is a whole entirely beast from hell. I have been taking Suboxone ever since getting off of the oxy's and it keeps my pain levels to a managed level and what is even better| does not make me crave the drug for more which happened on the oxy's.

At first| I was given muscle relaxers and neurontin due to the fact that my back would start going into spasm| starting near the injury and spreading to entire back to the point where I couldn't stand up and I had to lay on ice to kill the pain. Couldn't move my arms| would start screaming when the ice pack warmed up| etc. The muscle relaxers only succeeded in knocking me unconcious for hours at a time. If I didn't take them| I would wind up calling an ambulance because being awake I could not take the pain. At the hospital| they gave me morphine| which helped but was so strong that I couldn't function. I begged the dr to put me on some pain medicine that would allow me to be awake and deal with the pain. We experimented with a couple| and this one had the least amount of side effects for me. It allowed me to remain concious and to be active enough to start rebuilding my strength. I still have chronic pain syndrome| and take 5 mg of oxycodone 4x a day| the only thing that I would complain about is the fact that it causes me constipation| which is true of any pain medicine.

1191,1195, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,2,1,hink doctors are too quick to prescribe this medication for pain. With time you become tolerant to it and have to increase the dosage to have the same pain killing effects. Even if you stick to the exact prescription amount your body becomes physically dependant upon it and it becomes very difficult to get off of due to very uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. Doctors do not warn patients of this when they prescribe it by my experience and by the time you find out it is too late ... my advice is if you can avoid taking this medication ...do so... It is very highly controlled and if you do run out for whatever reason before your next script is due| they will not prescribe you more and you will be forced to go through withdrawal syptoms| which are simply horrible ...on top of the pain from your injuries or sickness. Quite simply the pain killing abilities of this drug are very good but is it worth what you will have to go through when it is time to stop... Also it causes illeus (slowing of the bowl) and constipation.. I honestly wish i never was given any of this medication... I should have just had the surgery i was trying to avoid rather than trying to control my severe pain with these pills because i now find myself in a situation where i might have to check myself into a rehab to get off of these things ..i had never taken a single drug in my life now i find my body physicaly addicted to something i believed was going to help me..

I do not plan on taking them for more than a couple months until my new med for my depression kicks in| because i know i can work with the pain i have and avoid surgery| unless i mess it up at work| which i have to be very careful how hard i push waiting tables to make that cash.

I was miserable before I started taking the medication after arm surgery. I told my orthopedic surgeon about what I had discovered| and he told me what my PCP and GI doctors had always denied| that it was no shock to him because the drug is routinely used to control the pain and diarrhea of Crohn's. He continued prescribing not because of my arm| but because of the vast improvement in my quality of life.||The labels that are automatically affixed to you when you're on this medication are by far the worst part of being on it.  Not only do you worry about doctors judging you| but you have yourself to worry about.  It really got to me| especially since my GI doctor said that they don't use it any more for symptoms| and my PCP accused me of abusing it.  Despite the fact that my dosage hadn't changed any| and that I was indeed taking it for severe pain| I let it get to me.||I chose to come off of the medication because of all of the labels I was afraid of having thrown at me.  I regret my choice now.  I was terrified that withdrawals would be the end of the world. I have a terrible fear of nausea and vomiting| and was convinced by all medical literature that I would indeed fall victim to both.||I am happy to say that neither was an issue. I didn't really have any withdrawal effects| aside from sleeping for 2 days.  The only ill effects were the return of the disease symptoms. I was happy to convince myself that these were caused only by stopping the drug for a month or so| but it is clear that is not the case. ||I would recommend seeing a pain specialist to anyone who has to be on this for more than something temporary| as they are the only ones who won't judge| and can best help with self criticism.

Anyone who has had or has ""itching"" when taking this medication or ANY medication...it means that you are ""allergic"" to it! Please tell your physician...right away!  2.  People over 60 years of age who take this need to be careful with regard to ""dizziness"" or ""off balance"" because it IS strong. Maybe they could start with ""Hydrocodone-5mg"" which is less strong yet MAY work for them. If not| then Hydrocodone 7.5mg.  3.  There is something that happens after taking this medication for a long period of time. I believe| personally| between the SEVERE PAIN(which I suffer with my back| also) and the medication| it does cause you to become ""irritable"" and ""upset"" and ""angry"" and sometimes ""depressed."" No question. But| who WOULDN'T be all of those things after suffering for SO LONG?! Only people who have had SEVERE back pain or knee pain or shoulder or neck pain| etc.| or fibromyalgia can truly understand how all of that makes you feel. NONE of us ""WANT"" to be all of those things but it| I believe| goes along with the PAIN and the MEDICATION...combined.  Be careful w/doctors because if you call and say you ran ""short"" on the medication...they will begin to ""suspect"" that something is ""off""...even if you have to wait a few days or so.  After about a year or two| Oxycodone DOES begin to ""wear off"" at the same dose you started with. That is normal. You have become ""immune"" to the same dose. That is when you must ask the doctor for at least a ""stronger strength""....NOT ""MORE!"" Ask for 10mg rather than the 5mg tablets. That happened to me. I was taking 5mg 3 times a day...one at a time. Then| it did not work. I asked for ONE extra one| to help me sleep....NO WAY! The doctor would not give it to me! Instead| he wanted to give me ""MORPHINE!!"" Can you imagine! THAT is the STRONGEST of the narcotics! I said NO!! He ""dismissed"" me! Another kind doctor started me on ""10mg...4 times per day.""

Beware of medication. Although I think pain meds are great for some| they are dangerous for others.

Just be careful and hope that you will not go thru what I did. I felt like I couldn't breath and have had severe shakes from this. Also pulse problems. My pulse would flutctate from 66 beats to 148 beats to 80 beats. All within a few minutes. I now am seeing a cardiologist. I really think it is a  filler in the generic form of the medication.

Having suffered from back pain for about 8 years on and off I took a fall on the ice around Christmas. Began taking hydrocodone. Went from 5-650 to 10-650 until earlier this week. Twisted my back getting into the car and increased my pain by about 60%. Doc put me on this because I was taking too much of the other and was worried about my liver. This is an effective drug for my pain| at least at this time. It took a couple of days to get the pain under control but feel pretty good after 3 days. Scheduled for spinal fusing surgery in about a month and am somewhat concerned about tolerance and the types of meds that will be prescribed after the surgery but I will cross that road when I come to it. Before I started it I was barely functioning. Today I feel like I could at least cook a meal or sit for a long length of time. As far as addiction| well| I had a pretty long talk with the doc and she said that if you have chronic legitimate pain to not worry and there are ways to wean you off when and if you don't need it anymore.

1450,1457, NEnurse69| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have chronic back and nerve pain. I have been taking oxycodone for about 3 years now. I only take it when I am having pain.  This has kept me from becoming addicted like so many others have. My Dr. writes a script for 100 tabs.  This usually lasts me anywhere from 4 to 6 months and sometimes even longer.  Now to correct a misconception...Oxycodone is not Percocet| it is one of two medications in percocet| the other being acetaminophen (Tylenol).  My advise to anyone taking any narcotic...if you have an addiction| seek help immediately.  I am a nurse and have seen all to often the long term affects of users and abusers.  Life is to precious to throw away on any type of drug.  Remember medications are to heal or give relief| so if you are not sick or in pain...STOP before it is too late!,OxyCodone,35-44,Male

1453,1460, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) ,2,5,1,My husband has vack surgery over 3 years ago| at the time his Dr sent him home with Percocet| he has been on Oxycontin 80 mg and now Oxycodone 30mg. I can honestly tell you that our lives have been living hell because of his addiction to these meds. His Dr just keeps on refilling these RX's without a doubt. I have tried talking to his Dr about the addictions my husband has incurred due to these meds| but it does no use. The Dr is continuing to keep on refilling. These meds have changed my husband who I have been married to for over 10 years. He is not the same person I married and fell for. Even our children notice the different dad they now have. And its not a good thing..The drug mfg should also note with side effects comes lying| betrayal|stealing| and cheating. Whomever takes these pills seemed not to have a care in the world|they are so high on life while on these meds. We have lost our home| cars| money because of his foolish mistakes while on Oxycontin and Oxycodone| of course he takes more in the beginning of the prescription then paces himself as it gets closer to his refill. Very manipulating drug and if you have someone with this type of behavior anyways| the drug only magnafies it to its fullest extent. Not a good outcome. Trust me.,OxyCodone,35-44,Female
1454,1461, Roxxanne| 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I was on Percocet for over 2 years for back pain.  It helped a lot.  Yes it became addictive| but no I did NOT have to check into detox when I quit taking it.  I just quit.  Had trouble sleeping for a few nights| but that's about it.  I wasn't freaking out or throwing up or shaking.  Percocet is Oxycodone.  Also called Percodan.  It is not the same as Oxycontin.  Some people...  I had tried Vicodin| Oxycontin| and Darvocet.  The Vicodin made me sick| the Oxycontin did nothing unless I took it WITH Percocet| and the Darvocet only helped a little and I had to take twice as much.

1471,1478, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have been taking 10mg of Oxycontin twice daily for almost a year.  I use it to treat Fybromyalgia| migraines and arthritis.  This low dose combined with careful exercise have allowed me to live a reasonable life.  When things get to bad I add a daily dose of 2 Tylenol #1.  While I still battle many of the chronic symptoms the use of Oxycontin has been a lifesaver.  There have been several occasions when I have had to seek out additional pain relief but my Doctor has so far refused a higher dose. I also suffer from Parkinson's Disease and have developed a range of excersises that cover the fybro. and parkinson's needs.  I consulted with several specialists before developing my treatment program.  This includes my family doctor| a reumatologist| a psychiatrist| a mental health nurse| a neurologist and a physio therapist and a person well versed on accupuncture. Together we have reached a level where I am functioning in a relatively normal manner.  Oxycontin is a vital part of that program.,OxyCodone,45-54,Male

After that time| I stopped taking the painkiller as I thought the pain had subsided enough that I no longer needed it.  I am also an epileptic and take a very strict daily dose of phenytoin(generic for Dilantin).  The following day I began having aura's(mini-seisures)that continued until I started using the Oxycodone again.

1483,1490, glendola| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,4,5,3,I was diagnosed with pancreatitis in 2004.  I was prescribed vicotin| which didn't touch the pain.  I was the prescribed 20mg. of oxycontin.  That seemed to work incredibly| basically getting rid of 90% of the pain.  It seemed like I had my life back.  However| which is typical with opiates| your tolerance level and the need for more of it increases rapidly.  The second month| the doctor titrated to 40mg.  Again| the pain was 90% gone.  Ultimately| 2 months later he had me on 2 80mg. tablets three times daily.  At that point| I was a raging drug addict.  I didn't look for the medication for pain anymore| I just needed it so as not to go through withdrawal.  Needless to say| I ultimately had to go to a rehab| because I COULD NOT come off of them on my own.  I tried twice and I went through withdrawal that is not to be explained.  People that haven't gone through it think that it's like a hangover from drinking.  It's 10 times worse| especially the emotional aspect.  You become mad| unbelievably sad| you get a total feeling of impending doom| and if you're already pre-occupied with something| it's magnified 100 times.  Now after that horror story| I'm not saying that it's too much medicine for everybody| I'm just saying exhaust every other medication that is not opiate based| or an opiate that is much less potent.  It's DEFINITELY worth the try.  And make sure| truly| make sure it is prescribed by a PAIN MANAGEMENT doc.  General practitioners aren't aware of the damage these medications can cause.  I did abuse the medication| so if I hadn't I wouldn't have written this story| but I've heard the same story from people in which I know took at the prescribed rate.

They take my pain away| and that along with a burst of energy at times that these medications give me| I have very increasingly regained my life back.  There are risk factors involveds in taking these types of medications| but I say that if you really need them and are hurting| and can be responsible and take them responsibly| or be mature enough that| if you can't| have someone help you that Is responsible| try these medications out together. I highly recommend| and since I have been on these medications| which have been about two years now| I have regained so much of my life| and I feel like a new man.

This new pain med (15mg oxy) along with 60mg of CR KAdian 2X a day has seemed to help ease the pain somewhat better than the Percocet alone.  I'm suffering with neck pain at C5-C6 after having surgery 2 1/2 years ago for my C6-C7 with fusion.  Now added to the neck pain I have a ""dehydrated| herniated & degenerative"" disc in low back at L5-S1|on going for past 15 months now. My Neurosurgeon will offer 1 of 2 procedures to best relieve the 'round-the-clock agonizing low back & left leg pain.  I'm diagnosed with damaged nerves running bilaterally on both legs-most damage is left side.  It seems that as each week goes by my back/leg pain gets worse and more intense.  The meds only ""take the edge off"" so I can try to function on a daily basis.  Consume LOTS of H2O & Fiber to avoid...you know!  I agree with others| it's unfortunate that there are those out there abusing pain meds| which only makes US with REAL pain feel guilty or look like ""addicts"" when asking Dr. for refills| etc.  My Dr. is GREAT & I'm lucky to have a truly caring| understanding Dr. that is willing to help me as long as it takes til I begin 2 feel better.  In summary| I would recommend a CR-controlled release 12hr capsule 2x p/day(Kadian-I'm on 60mg-U can start lower mg) along with the breakthru fast acting(15mg Oxycodone-every 4hrs)as the best possible combo for relief.  It is helping me so far (it's been about a month on this ""new"" regimen). I will have my L5-S1 surgery in Feb. 2009 so I pray for significant relief-although the pain will most likely be 10-fold throughout my recovery period| but I'm praying the long term benefit will prevail!!

If dulling moderate to severe pain oxycodone is the one pain medication I and my mother will take with full confidence that our pain is dulled to the point of being tolerable and we don't have to worry with the side effects of the aforementioned pain relievers.

1591,1599, Harry-Xavier| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,4,5,4,I'm 28 and have had chronic back & neck pain since I was 20. I started on non-narcotic drugs like the anti-inflammatories but they didn't help much. Then I had the weaker opiates like codeine| dihydrocodeine and tramadol| which helped a bit but still weren't enough. I'm now on 60mg OxyContin/day| plus 5-10mg of the short-release form for breakthrough pain. It's the best painkiller I've ever used| but I still have pain all the time| just not as strong. My doc keeps offering to increase it but I don't want to as it makes me groggy and it's hard to wake up. OxyContin is supposed to last 12 hours| but it just doesn't| so instead of taking 30mg twice a day| I take a 20 when I wake up| a 10 about 6hrs later| another 20 in the evening and the other 10 around bedtime| which seems to work quite well. I've been on it daily for about 6 months now so am undoubtedly physically dependent on it. It's a very addictive drug which is why it's so tightly controlled| but there is a crucial difference between physical dependence and actual ADDICTION| which is psychological - I don't actually enjoy the effect| too much makes me feel nauseous and I have no desire to increase the dose so that doesn't concern me. It's an extremely effective painkiller but shouldn't be used for pain unless it's severe. I wouldn't take it if I wasn't in so much pain but it's undoubtedly the best painkiller I've ever had. CAUTION: NEVER take more than prescribed cause it can kill you - especially if mixed with acetaminophen (as in Percocet)| which poisons the liver. That's what killed Heath Ledger! Used as directed it's safe and effective - but the forms that are just oxycodone without anything else like acetaminophen are actually much safer| and the doses can be adjusted much more easily than in compound preparations. I find the long-release form (OxyContin) particularly convenient.,OxyCodone,25-34,Male

Anything you can name....epidurals| physical therapy| facet joint injections| acupuncture| nerve block therapy| TENS UNIT| ANYTHING....has NOT worked!!  Almost my entire spine is now falling apart.  However....I FINALLY found a ""kind"" physician who understands my pain and is prescribing the Oxycodone| and did not ""release me"" because I refused to take ""MS CONTIN"" which is MORPHINE!  Also...that doctor at a very well-known rehab here had been treating me all along for the WRONG CONDITION!!  My left SACROILIAC!!!  Yet.....HE was angry with ME!!!  Can you believe this??!!  Because he could not ""take"" being ""WRONG!!""  I refused to go on ""morphine"" and that was it with him and myself.  It was awful.  It took FOREVER to find a doctor to help| but....once in a great while| there ARE kind people out there and I happened to finally find one!!!  Did I pray?  You BET I did!  Usually I pray for everyone else and their trials| but back then...finally| ""I"" needed an angel.  I now am on ""10 mg"" of Oxycodone every 6 hours four times per day.  I HAD NO LIFE...but| now| at least he has helped me regain ""some"" of it back.  God Bless him!!  There should be MANY more ""EMPATHETIC DOCTORS"" out there!  Not EVERYONE in the world is a ""drug addict!""  They try to make you feel SO uncomfortable...even bringing the subject up.  NO MORE!!  As I had said before...SOMEONE| SOMEWHERE| should do a ""piece"" on TELEVISION regarding people in SEVERE CHRONIC PAIN!!",OxyCodone,45-54,Female

I got hooked and was taking about 8 325mg tabs a day. Urinatng was next to impossible. ||If you're having trouble urinating| man or woman| first thing is| guys dont stand. It sounds silly but the effort of controlling your muscles to stay standing and trying to urinate makes it to dificult when on this. Sitting makes it easier to relax. ||Next| dont try to force anything| bring a magazine and read it| breathe normally. Turn on the sink| i never thought running water would help but it really does. ||Okay and the final part| this sounds ridiculous but it works. Like i said dont force anything| just relax your muscles and listen to the water. close your eyes and just picture a stream or something.||I did all this and it worked for me.

You will become dependent on ANY narcotic if you take it long enough. It seems like everybody here talks about addiction. The fact is| only 1-2% of people will actually get addicted using this or any other narcotic for pain. What many of you people are talking about is merely a dependence on the drug and not an ""addiction."" There is a big difference and when coming off the drug| it should always be weaned slowly and yes| you will be sick for a day or two after stopping the drug| even with a slow weaning. It is normal. But it is not necessarily addiction. You need to know the difference between addiction and dependence because most of you people commenting here are talking about dependence and not addiction.

I am now going to be getting an epideral to take the pain away and hopefully not have to take the pain meds any more.  To those that talk about getting addicted| I personally feel that getting addicted to the med is all a psychological thing.  I know that withdrawls can become physical but| if you have an addictive personality then you will become addicted.  Otherwise it is about as addictive as a sugar rush. Even though most doctors like my own was very reluctant to give it to me I do not feel that it is something that you should be afraid of taking.  If you think about becomming addicted then you will.  If you are strong willed and respect yourself then there is no reason why you should be addicted to this med.  IT IS ALL A STATE OF MIND.

1798,1806, SIETEC| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) ,3,4,2,"I took oxycodone for about 3 years (maxing out at 400 mg Oxycontin per day) for severe back pain due to multiple etiologies.  It is definately an opiate that should be in Schedule-II for it's reward-cascade and ""euphoric"" effects (thus necessitating very careful increases in dosage) but it doesn't have the pain ""stopping power"" of some of the other C-II drugs such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone) or Actiq/Duragesic (Fentanyl Citrate).  In many of the patients I see (I'm an anesthesiologist and pain/addiction specialist) I think that as far as oral medicatations go (oxycodone is not commercially available in the US as an injectable formulation) hydromorphone is one of the most effective and my experience has been that it is less ""emotionally and psychiologically"" addictive than oxycodone.  If it were my personal and professional experience rating oxycodone against other full agonist ORALLY AVAILABLE opioids| I would say that in terms of pain relief:||(I don't include fentanyl as an oral opioid since it's bioavailability is so low that it cannot simply be swallowed and be effective)||Methadone (Methadose) >> Oxymorphone (Opana) >> Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) >> OXYCODONE >> Morphine Sulfate (Avinza| MS Contin| MS-IR| etc.) >> Hydrocodone (Lortab| Vicodin| etc.) >> Meperidine (Demerol)||"">>"" meaning ""greater than""; in other words the list goes from most to least potent||As far as psychologically addictiveness (i.e. creating feelings of euphoria)| I'd rank:||Oxymorphone >> Methadone >> OXYCODONE >> Hydromorphone >> Morphine >> Hydrocodone >> Meperidine||As far as creating physical tolerance and difficulty with discontinuation/lowering dosage| here's my opinion:||Methadone >> OXYCODONE >> Hydromorphone >> Oxymorphone >> Hydrocodone >> Morphine >> Meperidine||I hope this is helpful and please always consult a physician before changing your dosages.
