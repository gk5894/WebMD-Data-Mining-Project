2,2, Ocetech| 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,1,4,2,Tramadol does help a bit with the ghost pain in my hand but| it does absolutely nothing for my chronic sciatic  pain in my right leg.|,Tarmadol_oral,65-74,Male
3,3, virleo| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,1,1,1,A few years ago a doctor at an urgent care clinic prescribed this for a bad tooth infection that flared up over a weekend. I had to sign some sort of paper before leaving the office and then hand-deliver the prescription to my pharmacy. How disappointing it was to find that Tramadol didn't even touch the pain. It seemed to have NO effect whatsoever. The medications prescribed by my dentist - Vicodin and Penicillin VK - did help ease the pain until the infection was cleared up. Throughout my life I haven't needed to take much medication for severe pain| but when I have needed something| Vicodin and Percocet have been so effective that I've usually taken only half the dosage prescribed.,Tarmadol_oral,55-64,Female
5,5, Mtdwnurse1| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,4,4,4,"After my neck fusion to my cervical C5|6|7| bone spur removal| and spinal stenosis plus suffering from ankylosing spondylitis I was on dilaudid for 2 weeks post op| at my 2 week follow up I asked to taper to percocet| several weeks later I then asked to taper to tramadol and Celebrex. 9 months later my neck feels better but living with AS| which there is no cure| can be debilitating. The occasional tramadol and daily Celebrex have worked wonders for me at this time. Prior to my cervical fusion 4 years prior I had a Lumbar L4-5 fusion which finally has healed as well. Tramadol may not be for everyone or work on everyone but I've had good results. You have to figure out what least amount of mind alternating drug works for you. If it's truly for pain that a person is taking it for it should bind to the pain receptors and help with the pain. If it's not for pain then it doesn't have a receptor to bind to causing a ""high"". If it doesn't work the receptor in your brain may need a different medication to bind to| to help relieve the pain you are having. Remember there are many different medications for this reason. And always remember it's usually not likely to have ""0-10"" pain rating. Most people have pain and suffering of some sort and everyone reacts to pain differently then the next person. I've been giving pills to people for 20  years as a nurse as well and never once have seen tramadol have negative side effects such as: seizures| etc. Hope this helps.. :)",Tarmadol_oral,45-54,Female

As for the dreaded constipation with most prescription pain drugs| I do not take any prescription meds for that| as I have found that one yogurt a day and a healthy serving of something with fiber works for me.

It doesn't keep me up at night like other opiates (i've tried many others) but what I love most about Tram's is that they aren't as addicting as the other opiate pain meds on the market! Take 1 tramadol and the pain goes away! Not to mention it puts me in a great mood- not like a ""high"" or euphoria but almost like what an antidepressant should do- or a mood enhancer. I don't find it addicting as it is extremely mild| but it definitely gets the job done. I've been on it for months and i'm so glad I asked my dr to switch me from Oxycodone to these. Tramadol also helps with my anxiety too! Only downside is that they give me headaches sometimes. I bought Tramadol at this shop https://drugstoresale24hss.com/tramadol. Maybe it helps someone.

I don't take tramadol every day but I take 50 mg when the pain gets bad from it. Usually it works and the pain feels a lot better and either I have much less pain or the pain goes away. If it gets really bad I take oxycodone| but I try very hard to stay away from that because of its addictive potential.

My doctor put me on Tramadol which works better than Ibuprofen but not as good as the half to 3/4 Vicodin.  However| the plus side is I can take the Tramadol (50 mg) 3 times a day so I have lowered pain| if not completely painless.,Tarmadol_oral,55-64,Female

I recently went off a low dose of hydrocodone/tylenol ( 5/325  twice daily) that I had been on for 6 months following extensive surgery to repair upper fibula/tibia joint.     No head aches or itching thus far taking the Tramadol 50 mg twice daily.   I have heard the withdrawal stories but believe some are more susceptible than others! And everyone is different.  Tramadol is definitely not an immediate substitute for real opiate pain relievers. Doc wanted me off hydrocodone for two weeks before starting tram!adol!   After going off Hrydrocodone I did experience some discomfort for a week.....unexpectedly because I had been on 4 times that amount for four years.... a few years before the ""opiate hysteria era"" started and tapered off without discomfort.   Docs prefer to use Tramadol (schedule III) which can be written with refills vs Hydrocodone even if warranted due to no refill thanks to now being schedule II.   So far Tramadol's only side effect is a little dry mouth and some slight drowsiness!    Pain relief is about 50% of a 5/325 hydrocodone.....but that's better than nothing and good enough for full function.!!",Tarmadol_oral,55-64,Male

I agree with a few of the negatives described| I don't sleep as well| constipation occasionally| but on the whole they totally work for me| and therein lies the solution for people| you have to find a pain medication that suits you| with maybe a few side effects that don't hinder normal everyday life.

After 3 week's of confusion| headache's| and other unusual side affect's my doctor discovered i actually have what they call Serotonin Syndrome because there is an interaction between taking Tramadol and Mirtazapine that i was also taking for my depression.  No-one before now has picked up on this. I'd been taking both together for at least 2 years. So I am now weaning off the Tramadol and have to try a different approach to pain relief as i also need to keep taking the Mirtazapine for my depression.

360,362, Thankful one| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,3,5,2,I have taken this medication for nearly ten years off & on for chronic pain issues related to injuries from a car accident| fibromyalgia| endometriosis etc. Most recently I was on a max dosage of 400mg daily finding myself always waiting & looking forward to my next dose. I ran out of this med on a friday & requested a refill through my doctor's on call service. They refused - I was devastated - had the worst most horrible withdrawal for 4-5 days. I am glad I am off this medication now. I have been trying to use otc meds sparingly along with 1-3 Lyrica daily & cymbalta (have taken both for years as well). I still have mild to severe pain at times - sometimes all throughout the day -  especially at night. The good part - I don't feel the need to take meds every 4-6 hours like I have -daily- for years. I feel pain & sometimes I can even function without meds - it's totally new to me. Don't get me wrong - I have to takes breaks while working. I have to lie down for breaks sometimes. Sometimes pain causes me to walk so slow at work people ask if I am okay - I just try to answer with a positive attitude & gather my strength to keep moving without reaching for meds. I am managing okay.  I could not have said this while on tramadol because I always needed the next dose & an hour after ingestion to feel good enough to get moving & mentally feel better. Do I think I was addicted? YES! Mind you - I never abused the med. I never took against the Rx directions. (I even refused to take the vicodin & percocet I have had in the medicine cabinet because I never wanted to become dependent on them.)  I was mortified when my doctor decided not to refill this med for me - but - I am so grateful for this. THE WITHDRAWAL WAS HORRIBLE. I really wish they would have let me titrate down though. (Perhaps I never would have realized the negative effects this drug had on my life though.) I am glad to be off tramadol & would warn anyone against taking the higher doses of this med regularly. |,Tarmadol_oral,35-44,Female

580,582, joel| 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,3,3,1,I was prescribed 50mg tramadol 3x a day for pain due to degenerative discs in my neck. The doc said it was a mild pain reliever and good for managing long term pain issues. It helped somewhat| enough for me to continue it's use for years but after about 3 years I started to feel unwell. I was getting terrible jitters and having problems sleeping. My heart rate and blood pressure remained normal but inside I felt like I had consumed a dozen double espressos. I couldn't sleep without medication. I thought it was stress related and it took months for me to determine that my body was craving more tramadol. It was as though I walked through a physiological doorway and while the medication helped with the pain in my neck| the amount I was taking daily was not enough to satisfy my physical need for it. I tried to wean myself on my own and the withdrawal was horrendous.I finally broke down and saw my personal physician| not the doc who prescribed the medication and I have been on a several month process of weaning myself. I haven't had any tramadol in several weeks and still feel jittery but I can see the end I think. I am sleeping better but still need medication to do so. The process has been REALLY difficult for me and my family. I'm writing this to warn anyone thinking of using this pain killer to think twice before doing so. If you ask this medical professionals this should not be happening but tramadol acts like an opioid though it isn't technically and it's a bear to stop after long term use.

After 2 wks| shoulder and hip pain are still gone| lower back still hurts and stiff but only a dull ache instead of constant pain and mid back is bothersome. side effects are; constipation| problem urinating (stream not as hard and going more often) and reduced sexual functions (this alone will stop me from taking the meds).  ||I will continue taking for 30 days along with the stretching and then decide if I want to continue taking the meds.

People are under dosing or simply have a different metabolism.||The thing about tramadol is it makes you feel good too. Its like a rush of serotonin. You may have to take it month to get that| but once you do its like an anti depressant| you will be the most happy person in the world.

I recommend that when you take this drug you take as little as possible.  I take 1/2 pill at a time (25mg).  If you read the reviews here| you will notice that the people that take 1-3 pills a day| but not every day have the best long term results.  You want to avoid tolerance or you will end up in pain and physically addicted.  Giving your body time to dry out in between doses is important| even if it's only 12 hours.  I take 1/2 pill at a time so that my body does not get used to a high dose hit.  I take the other half 1-3 hours later.  If you can supplement your pain management with OTC medication in between the Tramadol when drying out| even better.  If you have chronic pain| less is defiantly more with Tramadol.

I must admit it bothers me reading all these bad side effects being i take other medications as well but atleast i can work without being dizzy or feeling drugged up on the Tramadol.  Its prescribed to me 50mg 1-2 every 8 hrs but i usualy just take one or two a day and use naproxen with it when needed then alternate with vicodan.  I do this because i dont want to become so addicted to it and have to go thru what some here say they have or are going thru.  All I can say is be careful and watch your body for signs of addiction.

The tolerance is going up but that is after taking it over a year.  It takes away all headaches and muscle pain from Fibro Myalgia.

Don't drink alcohol at all and the only other meds I have is Firocet and xanax/valium.  Don't need the last two now that I have the Tramadol.  It will work differently with everyone.  For the most part it is a life saver for me.  If I use too much at once I do get over anxious.  So take as prescribed.  I have never had to take more than 2 1/2 per day.

1293,1296, joyjoyjoy| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,5,5,My doctor originally prescribed 100mg/day for fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathy. Over the course of 4 years of treatment| I had gone up to 200mg/day with adequate pain relief. The problem started in April when I asked my doctor to go to 250mg. He agreed| and called it in| but no longer did I have refills. I had to call every 30 days to get a refill approved. The bottle from the pharmacy said 'Please call 72 hours in advance for refill approval' so I did. I got a nasty call from the doctors nurse telling me that if I needed more meds so early| I had to get an appointment and come show the doctor why I needed them so soon. I wasn't out| I had about 5 days worth left| as I didn't always take the full dose. She finally did call the pharmacy and refill it| with strict instructions that I couldn't pick it up until day 30. I decided right then and there to wean myself off. It did take me 3 more months to wean off| but I did it. Haven't had a tramadol since August. I can REALLY tell now how much benefit I was getting from the drug. My moods were better (tramadol acts on serotonin| and thus should never be taken with an SSRI antidepressant) my RLS was very infrequent| I had bounds of energy| even my asthma was better (tramadol can act like a bronchodilator in some people| this is considered a side effect). I even lost 90 pounds over the four years. Now| two months off it| I am exhausted constantly. Nothing seems to help. My RLS is back with a vengeance making it even more difficult to sleep| and I've gained back 10 pounds. Tramadol is an opioid| not a narcotic as some commenters have said. Yes| it has the potential for addiction and abuse| and yes| getting off it after long term use is difficult. Would I go back on it if I had the option? Yes| in a heartbeat.,Tarmadol_oral,35-44,Female

1301,1304, Melanie| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,5,4,I started taking Tramadol after I had surgery or cancer. Then I took Tramadol for severe Menstrual Cramps. It stops pain| but as another reviewer mentioned- it makes you happy. Its hard to explain but I call them my Happy Pills. This is probably in people who tend to have anxiety| as it lessens anxiety. It also gives you energy initially| and then gives you a good night's sleep as it wears off. Make sure not to take it too close to bedtime- at least 3-4 hours before bed because of the initial subtle energy rush. ||I have heard that Tramadol can be addicting| but as long as you wean off them| as recommended| you'll be OK- take one less pill a day| and your last pill take at about 3PM. You may have one night of insomnia and pains| but that will disappear the second day.,Tarmadol_oral,45-54,Female

I think that addiction depends on an individual's brain chemistry in relation to the specific substance.

1331,1334, brookied21| 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,5,2,I was taking this medication for back pain and was on it for a little over two years. It definitely helped relieve my pain and let me function like a normal person again. However| the longer I was on it| the more I grew a tolerance to it| and needed to take more and more. I maxed out at taking 9 (50mg) pills a day| and was obviously very addicted. I experienced horrible withdrawals when I ran out of the meds| and when I finally got off of them. Today I am taking morphine for my pain| which helps| but is not much better when it comes to withdrawal. I am currently weaning off of the morphine and am back on the tramadol to help with the process. So users of this medication beware! It helps with pain but is very addictive.

When pain sets in it works very well.  But the last month or so I've been taking them almost every day anywhere between 3-6 a day for maybe 5 or 6 weeks.  Although I find it very helpful it is very addictive.  I stopped taking it a few days ago and am experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms.  A violent headache| cold sweats| severe mood sings and uncontrollable tremors.  Also the last two nights I could hardly fall asleep at all.  Although while I was using the medication| I would have an occasional convulsion| I did not find that particularly troublesome.  I went to the Dr today and he gave me Fioricet which has helped| but I am still am unable to sleep.  It has been very embarrasing to admit that I guess I am addicted. My advice is PLEASE take the absolute minimum necessary to feel comfortable and try to avoid taking it daily for an extended period of consecutive days so you don't get too used to it.  And when I say extended period I'm talking about a few days not weeks or months.  People are different but for me| it was too late at that point.  I hope this is helpful.,Tarmadol_oral,25-34,Male

I am now taking 50mg of Tramadol| which is like taking nothing at all. Pain level just keeps going up & down| but the constant pain (9 at times) never goes away. Will ask for higher dose. Side effects: sweating| walk like I just got off a boat (rocking motion)| eyes hurt| dizziness| headache| nausea| shaking| agitation| dry mouth| clenched teeth| blurred vision| feel very unsteady. These come about 2 hrs before my next dose except for the 1st three (which are always there) and continue for another 2 hrs til the drug starts working. Will ask for higher dose. Also take Neurontin 200mg. It hasn't done anything yet. Will ask for much higher dose. One thing is for sure--no more narcotics! I read Tramadol is addicting| but I can deal with that if it just works.,Tarmadol_oral,65-74,Female

This medicine did nothing to help my Arthritis but was fairly effective relieving my back pain but at a cost.  I was in a constant fog while on this medicine and had an extremely hard time concentrating.  Over time I found it harder and harder to sleep and I started to get tremors in my hands and my right arm would twitch uncontrollably.  I knew it was time to get off this. Problem was this was way easier said then done.  I do not have an addictive personality and have never had a problem getting off other so called addictive pain| anxiety| and depression meds before.  This stuff is nasty to get off of.  Tried cold turkey. Bad mistake. Tried skipping every other dose.  Nope not an option.  Had Cold sweats| nausea| shaking| tremors| irritability| ringing in the ears| and diarrhea to name a few withdrawal symptoms.  Had to take full doses during the day and 1/2 dose at night with my Trazadone for a couple of weeks before I could 1/2 my daytime doses.  Even then things were not fun for a little while.  Never again.,Tarmadol_oral,45-54,Male

I was tired much of the time and took long naps when able.  I would get so tired when driving that I often would ask my wife to drive.  I knew I was addicted but it took a long time to be willing to get off of it.  I gave the pills to my wife to dispense to me on a slowly tapering regimen.  (This was after trying to do so alone many times.)  I had a very high level of discomfort during my drug withdrawal.  There were many nights of little sleep.  As much as the drug gave me a mild buzz for those three years| the withdrawal gave me an intense agony for three or four weeks...especially at night (I suppose my body was begging for the drug.)|If you are considering this drug| keep in mind that unless you stay on it the rest of your life| you will have to face the consequences of withdrawal when you decide to quit...and if you are like me| once off it| will never take it again.,Tarmadol_oral,55-64,Male

I started with a dose of 100 milligrams per day and eventually went to 150 MG a day. I took it for pain after a car accident. I did not want to take narcotics so my doctor recommended Tramadol because of its low dose of narcotic. After 7 months I realized I did not need it anymore so I stopped taking it. Thats when the symptoms of withdrawal came.Ihave been off of it for 2 weeks and the symptoms are still as bad as the first day of not taking it. I have been riddled with anxiety| panic attacks| sleeplessness diahrea and my body twitches constantly.

1520,1524, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,5,5,I have chronic joint pain due to Systemic Lupus. this medication works fairly well in keeping the pain at a manageable level. The best part for me is the lack of discomfort from digestive side effects such as constipation| nausea| and vomiting which are common with opiate derived pain relievers. This is very important to me since my Lupus also tends to manifest with GI disorders which can be quite awful without any help from drug side effects.  The Tramadol does not add to this. I do wish it lasted longer| however| I'm prescribed to take 100mg/8 hours| but the peak of the effectiveness only lasts for maybe 2 hours.  And I have noticed a marked decrease in my sex drive| but this could be from my Tizanidine or the pain itself. Honestly though| there is no such thing as a completely safe pharmaceutical and I would rather that marijuana was legal for medical use in my state.  I'd rather use a natural fully non-addictive plant that is  non-toxic to all the body's systems when ingested or inhaled through a vaporizer and cannot cause overdose or organ damage of any kind unless it is smoked (and then very rarely).

I would NOT recommend this medicine for treatment of short-term pain.  According to a pharmacist friend of mine| Tramadol is a synthetic morphine that has been stripped of its high.  In my experience| that is completely correct.  I got every side effect of morphine exception the happy feeling that makes you not care about the side effects.  Nasuea - check| confusion - check| dizziness - check| withdrawal symptoms - check (and I was only on it for 5 days)etc| etc.  I have noticed that most of the postive reviews for this medication are by people who have been on it for several years.  Perhaps after a long enough period of time| you get used to the side effects. But for short term use| ask your doctor for something else.,Tarmadol_oral,25-34,Female

1546,1550, kv| 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,4,5,2,I injured my shoulder and was prescribed 50 mg of tramadol for the pain. It worked fine to reduce the pain but the side effects were unpleasant. Even after only 2 pills I was affected by this drug. The effects I experienced are headache| sore throat| dry mouth| feeling thirsty| burning dry eyes (I wear contacts and they became uncomfortable)and constipation. I also felt dizzy| drowsy and nauseous even thought I took it with food. It was surprising that such a small dose would give me such noticeable side effects. It's not really worth taking| I think there are better pain meds out there| especially for a minor injury like mine. Maybe it's better for more severe pain related to a serious condition.,Tarmadol_oral,25-34,Female
1547,1551, JennyT| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,5,"I was perscribed this medication after an injury (I teach fitness). I have been on anti-anxiety/anti-depressants for the past 15 years (runs in my family). I had the unexpected relief of nearly ALL of these issues when I began taking Tramadol. I can see from the other reviews that everyone is reacting to this drug very differently-but I want others to know who have tried everything for anxiety/depression| that the emotional suffering for me with my depression and anxiety was tremendous| affected my life every day. I was basically partially disabled emotionally. This drug does not make me feel ""high"" or medicated| I just feel like a normal person. This drug has made an UNBELIEVABLE improvement in my life| I hope some research will be done on how this drug is working in this way. I take 200MG a day and am like a new person. THANK GOD FOR TRAMADOL!!! I realize I may become addicted| but I had to take a bunch of medication before this anyway-so I see no difference. I am careful to take this med. at the same times each day| 100mg soon as I get up| another 100mg by 3:30-4:00. I have not noticed ANY side affects. I am a 40 year old woman| 5'7"" and 130lbs.

I almost died from using these drugs concurrently.  Many neurological issues| including extreme numbness| problems with memory and orientation| etc.  For more info| check drug.com for interactions.

1549,1553, leechapman | 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,4,4,4,response to a couple of people on this med.. yes it does cause loss of appetite.. it is a commomn side effect and i recommend eating prior to taking the med.. and for the other person| yes it can cause a rash and is common side effect.. it should go away.. for the med to be effective you need to get into your system for a few days and then see. i take it for fibromyligia and disk degenetive disease..I also space out my meds.. I dont take meds together|| because of potential side effects from combining meds. i wait 1 hr and that is okay to do.. sometimes you just need to find the right combination of meds to work for you. it sucks with the limited of pain meds available now and prescription abuse is on the rise and so the people in actual pain have a hard time getting meds that they need| and it is to bad. yes it causes constipation but increase your water and fiber intake and it is okay to take a laxative too. to help.

The reduction in perceived pain is dramatically reduced. As I tried to come off this drug I experienced severe withdrawl from dependency. I would characterize it as severe depression| not just anxiety. Nausea| runs| cramping| severe cold sweats| shaking. Long term use seems to also be affecting urine flow and kidney water retention. I am being treated now for the dependency and side effects. So Tramadol is very|very effective when on the drug but not so good trying to come off the medication.

I take 50 mg in the a.m. before work| and if my level of activity begins to become more of a struggle| I will take another dose but not too much later in the day| it can cause sleeplessness to a degree.  I have migrain headaches too| and this seems to keep the onset to a minimum| less is more on that note.

1665,1670, fat democrat| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,4,4,I use this for herniated discs.  It is not nearly addictive as the hydrocodone or other opiate type drugs.  It also does not have the increased tolerance build up that accompanies those type of drugs.  It doesn't work as well as those in the short term.  If you take one| it is not going to feel better 1 hour later.  I have found if you take them TID and stay on them they work. You don't think they are working as you still have moderate pain.  If you go off of them though| you have more severe pain.  I do not sleep as well on them.  I get up a lot though the night when I am on them.  This may be partially why my back does not hurt so much the next morning--I'm not lying down 8 hours sraight| but instead gettin up 2-3 times a night and stretching it out. They are addictive.  They definitely work on your seratonin.  But| like prozac| the dependance is not going to inhibit your ability to function or live a very productive life.  At first| they give you energy| which makes them appeal to the very ambitious person who has a lot of drive.  I think they  are over looking advantages of this drug to use in lieu of SRIs when zolofts or lexapros don't work on people.  They have been out about as long as those drugs| so we should have seen the long term affects that they have on people.  A psychiatrist would probably say I was out of my mind though.  I don't know.  So| if you have moderate anxiety or depression and back pain that is in the modrate to severe category| this drug| although controversial| may be the answer for you!!!,Tarmadol_oral,35-44,Female

I then advanced into Vicodin and Tramadol mixed| but fortunately am now getting treatment which has saved my life.

1694,1699, holmar| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,5,3,I have multiple sclerosis.  I used to take narcotics but my doctor didn't like me taking them due to my age so he wanted me to try something else.  I was nervous because I seem to have bad reactions to a lot of medications and really have to stick with the fairly simple ones| not the newer ones.  Anyway| surprisingly| I was able to switch very comfortably from a relatively high dose of vicodin which I tried to stop but went through withdrawals| to the ultram.  Funny thing is| I was able to switch one to the other without any withdrawals.  SO| I am sure it attaches to the same receptors.  Anyway| it still worked just as good for my pain without the warm fuzzy feeling (but that's ok).  Not only that| but I had never been able to take antidepressants and I have always suffered from depression| but I can take the ultram and it has helped SO much.  It gave me pain relief and worked as an antidepressant when I couldn't take the SSRI's.  To me its a miracle drug| except one time when I lost the pills in hawaii.  Not only did I go through narcotic withdrawals| I also went through antidepressant withdrawals| I had aching| restless legs| severe depression| felt like I was crawling out of my skin| sweating and brain zaps|which were like electric jolts going through my head.  In addition| I have to wake up a little earlier then usual and take a tramadol then go back to sleep or I will wake up with withdrawals.  For me it works very well but is extremely addicting.  If I ever ran out| I am sure it would be worse for me then narcotic withdrawals but my doctor doesn't seem to think so| so I will just go with it.  It helps with my pain and depression.  Someday I would like to get off of it| but I don't know if I could simply because of the withdrawals.  It also gives me energy.  It seems to either work well for people or not at all.  Well| that's my 2 cents worth.,Tarmadol_oral,35-44,Female

Tramadol is the only prescription pain med I've been prescribed that allows me to have relief from pain| and still be able to function and have a clear mind.  I have suffered the withdrawal symptoms that others described| but the key is to not take this medication on a daily basis. I've found that taking one or two days off every week is very helpful in avoiding any sort of negative withdrawal symptoms. On my ""off"" days I rely on Aleve| which is not enough to rid me of all my pain| but it's worth it knowing I won't suffer from any sort of physical/mental dependence on the tramadol.

You may notice that you become 'hyperactive' depending how much you take at one time. I don't recommend doing that.  I found it works best for me because I spread out my dosage throughout the day taking it morning| noon and in the evening- so I don't wake up in the middle of the night with back pain.  If you are going to stop taking this medication for any reason| do it slowly because you will experience withdrawal symptoms: upset stomach| diarrhea| restless legs| muscle/joint pain| headache| and sleeplessness. It happened to me when I waited too long for a refill.  It is overall a good drug for pain because it is non narcotic-even though it says it can be addictive.

Of those| if suffering as I did| try rhodiola rosea| saffron| L-theanine. They have some efficacy. When a new neurologist suggested tramadol| I complied. The analgesic effects are outstanding for this type of pain| superior to any others I have tried. Years later it still works like the first time! Tramadol has no tolerance building effect| no doped up fogginess| and for me very little serotonergic withdrawal symptoms if I skip a few days. Tramadol does not cause opiod withdrawal. Period. Know the medication that you take and how it works. The slight opiate receptor agonism is so slight that I don't think it plays a significant role in its effectiveness. There is slight mood elevation similiar to a mild MDMA dose. That is all| no opiate-like high. I am so thankful for tramadol. Real pain = real relief.,Tarmadol_oral,35-44,Male

He did not have to be admitted and did go through withdrawls but did detox and today he is fine and will never take this medicine again.

I have to say that I have found it to be extremely effective. As one of my symptoms if fatigue| Tramadol helps by giving me a burst of energy and a sense of well-being besides relieving me of my pain. I could not tolerate the antidepressant therapies tried| so Tramadol is all I take.  I usually can get by with just 1 a day| but can increase to 2 a day if needed.  I have not experienced any of the bad effects I read in this forum.  One thing to always remember when reading these reviews.....each person is different with different problems. What works for one person| doesn't always help another.  For me| this works!  No drug therapy is perfect.

2084,2092, STXan| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,4,5,4,My review is for the non-extended release version| Tramadol hcl| 50mg.||I started taking this for a rotator cuff injury.  It dulls the pain enough to make it tolerable| but the pain never completely goes away.  That has been fine for me.||The first few days I took it| I did have a little dizziness and some headaches| but they don't happen anymore.  ||I have found that this medication allows me to focus and work without a problem.  In fact| strangely enough| it actually makes me feel less anxious and happier--in a non-narcotic way.  It works like an anti-depressant| for me.  ||However| I do have to take it every 4 to 8  hours| depending on the level of pain.  I suppose it's worth it--I can't take aspirin or ibuprofen.||The downside of this medication is the horrible withdrawal side-effects I have experienced.  I have tried to quit taking this medication several times--just because I thought I might be taking it for too long--but it is next to impossible to reduce the medication and deal with the withdrawal problems when you have other things going on.  I know it will take a huge effort and a lot of time.||Honestly| if I had known how physically addictive it was| I don't know whether I would have started taking it.  As long as I keep some level of the medication in my bloodstream| I'm fine.  But| if I miss a dose or go longer than I should| those withdrawals remind me.  Sometimes I feel like a heroin addict.||It's has been both a blessing and a curse for me.||,Tarmadol_oral,45-54,Female

I have Crohn's disease and cannot take NSAIDS for pain| so it is either tramadol| or a more powerful narcotic.  I developed a fistula last year that has been very painful| and really altered my mood| so I also take an antidepressant now (Lexapro) and even though these two meds are strongly contraindicated| I have not had any problems with taking both.  Tramadol is classified as an opiod / non-narcotic| so I have never felt any of the euphoria experienced with stronger pain meds| although when I have stopped| or attempted to stop| I have had withdrawal symptoms (i.e. malaise| chills| shaking| insomnia| nausea).  I have now grown a tolerance for it| and it no longer releives pain for me though.  It did work for a good while| especially before my recent surgery a month ago.,Tarmadol_oral,25-34,Male

2090,2098, Maggie| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,3,5,3,This is a great med for pain| but should be classified as a narcotic and under a more restricted care when being dispensed by doctors.  I know several people that are addicted to this drug| because it works like a anti-depressant as well as pain relief and it can be bought anytime online for any of the drug abusers.  It is like a form of an opiate and has the same effects as opiates when trying to get off of them.  It is only now coming to most doctors attention how addictive this drug can be and they are being more careful with prescibing it.  If you are only using it for a short term| like a few days for a injury| it works great| but be careful of any long term use because of the addiction you would get from taking viocodin or oxycodone or any narcotic drug on long term basis.,Tarmadol_oral,55-64,Female

This is far from true.  I took it as prescribed twice daily for fibromyalgia. If ever I missed my am dose I got withdrawal symptoms by noon.  Had to go to the hospital to get off of it.  I was sicker than addicts going off hard core drugs.  I couldn't even leave my room.  DON""T TAKE IT EVERY DAY!! Now that I'm off it I have to say it didn't really do anything.

I was also intermittently taking Percocet for breakthrough pain at the onset of menstruation and after surgery. However| I chose to discontinue taking Percocet even when offered (as it worked most effectively) because I believed Tramadol was a safer option. I want to make clear that I have never been addicted to anything| in fact| I don't even drink. That being said| Tramadol is highly addictive! While I have never had a euphoric feeling nor have I exhibited drug-seeking behavior; if I had forgotten my script or had neglected to pick it up before the pharmacy closed| horrendous withdrawl would immediately set in. I have done extensive research on opiates and opiate-acting drugs and the literature on Tramadol is extremely misleading. If you are taking this drug for long-term pain relief and hope to eventually stop| please do it slowly or you WILL feel the effects and they are very unpleasant. They are very similar to the withdrawl symptoms of the most highly-addictive opiates; restlessness| anxiety| loss of energy| cold sweats| tremors| diarrhea and so on... Just be careful and know that you are tricking your brain into thinking that you've taken an opiate so when you stop| your brain will crave that ""opiate."" Some have said the Tramadol withdrawl is worse than that of stronger| narcotic pain-relievers because unlike its opiate cousin| it contains an element that elevates your serotonin (hence the ""speedy|"" overly content feeling) which plummets once stopped adding to the already low| uneasy feeling.

Been taking for many years very addictive.  Yes it works great but is it worth problems?  NO!If you're looking into drug before filling your prescription then it's not too late for you to ask dr for something else. I fell into my husband's arms-luckily not the concrete at an amusement park and suffered another seizure and unconciousness.  Ended up in ER again.  That's it.  No more.  Have stopped takind it since last Saturday. Told doctor I can't take it anymore.  The only reason I made it through the week without severe withdrawl is because I had vicodin to take.  Isn't that ironic that the narcotic helped me get off the non-narcotic without withdrawl.  Should be the other way.  Just trust me I've been taking for so long and can take so much thats why I had the seizure. Eventually you'll probably have a reaction- maybe not a seizure| but addiction| withdrawl inevitable. I wish I could go back in time and never start.  I pray I can stay off it this time for good.  I hope this helps someone before this happens to them   Good luck to all.,Tarmadol_oral,35-44,Female

I can't stand the feeling I get from narcotics. This med actually gives me lots of energy during the day and helps me sleep at night. I also have restless leg syndrome. It takes care of all of it. I have been on it for 4 years now. The only downsides are the crash u get when you wait too long for the next doese  and withdrawals. The withdrawals are bad enough to kill you. I stopped taking it when I got pregnant and had to be hospitalized for a week and be put on IV stadol to get rid of withdrawals. I stopped taking it again when I could no longer afford it  and ended up in the hospital again. I had migraines| severe panic attacks| I lashed out at my kids and actually hated them. I have never been so angry and shaky in my life. It's an absolute nightmare. But as long as you don't stop cold turkey it's great. I still have mood swings when the drug starts to wear off and I still get occasional headaches but nothing near as bad as I had when I wasn't taking it.  I also have depression and bipolar disorder which also adds to the rage and irritability that I have. I can't say whether or not the tramadol makes them worse or better because I do not know. I am not currently on meds for the bipolar and depression so once I start taking meds for that we'll see how it all works. But as far as my pain goes| it is non-existent with tramadol.

It's definitely not for severe pain| but it does an adequate job with moderate pain.

2572,2582, JBK-2000| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,5,5,re's the deal with Tramadol| folks.  It can be a miracle drug for one person and a complete waste of time for another.  Many people report poor results and they blame the drug| when they should be blaming their own body chemistry.  I am in the miracle drug category.  Thanks to Tramadol| I am now able to live pain free (Extremely rare testicular disorder requiring several surgeries).  If you are looking for the euphoria or pain relief recieved from traditional opiate agonists| you're barking up the wrong tree.  That being said| it does provide a mild sense of contentment and serenity(probably due to the fact that you're no longer in pain). Additionally| Tramadol does not impair cognitive functions like their opiate cousins.  For me| the most common side effects include: Mild constipation| sleeplessness| and mild upset stomach.  Never take over 400mg in one 24 hour period!!!!  The risk of seizure or other severe reaction increases immensely when you exceed this dose.  Many of the people on this message board obviously take the drug at incorrect doseages.  If your someone who needs powerful opiates a la oxycodone| this drug will probably be a big letdown.  If you are like me| and prefer the joy that comes with critical thinking (even if a little pain is involved) to the mind-numbing dopiness of traditional opiates| then Tramadol can be a lifesaver.
