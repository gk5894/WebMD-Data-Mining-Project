5,5, Ned| 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,2,5,2,"I've been taking pain meds for 40 years due to a industrial accident in 1978. I didn't start the methadone until 25 years ago| they started me on 40mg a day worked very good. After a auto accident| A different Doctor moved me up to 120mg because of a neck injury for around 6 years then decided to start taking me down to 40 mg a day. I was getting by with that and a breakthrough med| but wasn't able to get out and enjoy the things I did when on the higher dose. The middle of this month ""Aug"" he tells me he's not going to give me anymore methadone or breakthrough meds because of a new law that was passed a few months back. Now I am having restless legs| pain has came back| no sleep for 4 nights| so I'm in a heck of a mess now. Tried to get in a pain management| they said he should have referred me. Don't know what to do next. It gets worse every day. If you have a doctor| that will offer it| and you and need it| it works very well.",65-74,Male
7,7, Sunnygrl2015| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have had much pain relief from using methadone. I just do not like going to a Methadone Clinic on a daily basis to get my daily dose. I can't get take homes because I am a pot smoker| which also helps with the pain as well.,35-44,Female
8,8, awakeandaware| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,1,1,1,ASCEND LABS ASC 116 (generic) methadone 10mg are awful! been on methadone 10 plus years and now forced to take generic ascend labs never felt so bad! why is ascend labs allowed to produce such a crappy form of methadone with LOADS of side effects!!!! NO good! been so successful in treatment until NOW... please take these off the market they will help with opiate abuse prevention ..,35-44,Female
10,10, SCGiants| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,5,3,I have chronic back pain from numerous causes. I have been going to pain mgmnt for a decade now and started off w/ NSAIDS an worked up from there... hydrocodone| oxy... time released morphine pills| then Fentanyl patches (which almost killed me when a 3 day patch was released into me within an hour as my work was over 100 degrees and I was pouring sweat (heat released... as I later learned!). I didn't like living like a zombie tho. Dr. gave me Methadone to try and it was like a miracle drug at first. Took away all the pain except break thru pain and after a week I was used to it and felt no high or anything like that. Dr originally said it was safe even at high amounts. I was up to 120 mg/day (12 -10mg pills/day) 7 years later I HATE it as I believe it is killing me. I have lost all drive 100%| I get shaky from doing nothing at all|  ambition is all gone and I was highly ambitious and a hard worker... I cannot work anymore (I am 44 yrs old)| constantly fatigued| exhausted| pain is now all back and I am being weaned to half the dose to get to 60mg a day as they learned that anything over that greatly increases the chance for serious heart problems! My life is hell. My free testosterone level dropped to 40... should be 400... (read up on low testosterone levels). They gave me adderall to counter the constant exhaustion| which screwed w/ sleep and now I take ambien to sleep! It is a one way ticket to hell this stuff and I wish I never started it. It is the WORST possible drug to get addicted to as it is the worst to come off of and it has taken me over a year just to drop 40mg/day and every day is pure hell to live. DO NOT start this drug! I cannot stress enough how bad it is in the long run. I also believe it has screwed with my pineal gland and caused me to get Fibromyalgia which I never had any of the symptoms before. I honestly feel as if I am dying inside. I don't even have the energy to file for Disability and even showering daily seems like a huge undertaking.,35-44,Male
12,12, Lady59 chimo6| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,3,4,3,Was on this for about 6 yrs.| wasn't helping even with increased dosage. Dr decided to change my pain meds. I weaned off the methadone slowly & started noticing my legs no longer felt tight ( spasms| spasticity ) was very surprised that was the reason my legs hurt so all the time.,55-64,Female
14,14, Pain is LAME| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,5,I think Methadone is by far the best medication for chronic pain.  I was suicidal before being prescribed Methadone| and now the pain is much improved.  Saved my life.  I just hope people realize that not everyone abuses their pain medication.,45-54,Male
16,16, catlover123| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,5,4,Methadone is an excellent medication for deep set acing pain and| in my experience| only somewhat effective for sharp pain. It is easy to use and does not fog up the mind as much as other strong schedule 2 narcotics do. I recommend a chronic pain patient to give it a try if you are unsatisfied with your current pain medications.,55-64,Male
18,18, ladyhummingbird| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,My pain is chronic and severe. Mornings are the worst and at night it will awaken me. I take my methadone and it takes the pain from 10 down to 2. I have no bad side effects of any kind although I take the pill form 10mg.,55-64,Female
19,19, HeatherGo| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,My husband and I were in a car accident in October 2001| from which I am now paraplegic. Within a few months of my accident| I began having horrible pain in my hips. I was diagnosed with chronic pain due to Heterotopic Ossification| or bone growing in my hip joints. I started seeing a pain management doctor and for like two months he tried me on everything imaginable and nothing| NOTHING worked. I ended up going back in the hospital for other reasons and they started me on methadone and finally I had relief! It wasn't complete relief but I was able to function and live again. Since I first began taking it| doctors have decreased it| I currently take 40mgs three times a day along with Neurontin and Percocet and I've found that taking the three medicines together is what works the best for me. I still have my bad days| like we all do I'm sure| but I am just so very thankful that I found a combination that works well for me and gives me relief enough to be able to get out and live life| happily. This medicine has truly been a Godsend. I hope maybe I help others in some way by sharing my story. Take care....,35-44,Female
20,20, Zarr| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,This med is a God send. I have PAD (Peripheral Artery-Disease and neuropathy of the legs. I have been in this drug for 3yrs. I could not live life without.,45-54,Male
22,22, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,4,4,5,"I know this is a long review but I think it will be helpful for someone to read it in full. This is the best treatment for my addiction for me. I tried doing it on my own| I tried Suboxone| but I still had intense cravings. That is what bothers me the most| the cravings more than the physical withdrawals. Don't get me wrong though| I still hated the physical part. I was abusing Roxicdone and I would take up to 80 mg a day of it. For all the people talking about how they don't like it because it causes withdrawals| that is because methadone is an opioid (also known as a narcotic or an opiate) itself| and all opioids cause withdrawal symptoms after taking them for a long period of time. I started at 20 mg| then quickly went up to 50. After being on it for a few months I thought maybe I could taper and I got down to 20 and was okay for a few weeks| but the cravings came back and were really bad| so my clinic bumped me up to 30 and that's what I take now. I use the orange wafers (also known as disks or diskettes) and I like those better because those last longer. However to get you stabilized| most places will give you liquid only and then transfer you if you want to the wafers because the liquid does start working faster| but as I said the downside of the liquid is it doesn't last as long. Methadone isn't perfect| but it's been a godsend for me. I hate it that I got addicted so young (I am 19) and I don't plan on being on methadone forever| but because of it I have been clean of drugs besides prescribed medications for 4 months now. I have been on methadone longer but I did have a bit of a lapse where I took hydrocodone that wasn't prescribed| but since going back up on my dose from 20 to 30| I have been clean. If you are not as serious of an addict but still can't do it on your own| I think you should try Suboxone first. Methadone in my popnion should only be used if you are really severe (extremely high doses or ""shooting up"")| or if Suboxone has failed.",19-24,Male
24,24, greg| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,4,3,I became addicted to Lortab from pain from having joint bleeds.I have hemophilia.Have been on 120mgs for 13 yrs very expensive and long drive wish could get somewhere else.made me gain 85 lbs.but really don't know what I'd do without it but would be great to get off of it it's such a worry.,35-44,Male
25,25, will44| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,I was at first like many hating to be attached to a crutch.But if I don't take methadone i relapse because I am an addict 100% it's what Ive done since I was 15 is use drugs and I am 40 now.This drug has saved my life.I function normal as a regular member of the world.You don't have to worry about me stealing from you or breaking into your house or hurting someone to get my needed fix cause I am dope-sick.I work|have a happy marriage|and if I didn't tell you there is no way you would know my history.Ive been on it 10 years and i take 170mg a day at once and no it doesn't get me high!BREAK THE STIGMA METHADONE SAVES LIVES!!!!!!!!!!!,35-44,Male
26,26, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,1,1,Unless you are terminal| I advise you against taking this medication!!!  You are surrendering control of you physical and mental health to your prescriber. You will most likely need anticipate your refill date by 3-5 days (God Forbid you forget!)| pick up hard copies of scripts| run them to the pharmacy| wait for them to be filled...etc.  Also be prepared to continually justify your need for the medication as this is contend with repeated efforts to sell you on expensive epidural injections. Remember| that most if not all healthcare organizations and many physcians are PROFIT DRIVEN. AND| whenever you or your prescriber decides you should stop| be prepared to go through HORRIBLE WITHDRAWALS!|This happens even if you taper down gradually. This is because of the drugs very long half life. My experience has been that pain clinic prescribers either do not know how bad This is or do not care. The research on this is specific opioid is unavailable| only for opiates in general. What is out there is for methadone maintenance for heroin addiction treatment only| but not for chronic pain. Methadone is particularly insidious in that you don't feel the high| but it is a VERY strong drug! And| don't count on the support of your prescriber.  Sure they got you dependent on this opiate and profited from the many appointments| but most doctors and pain clinics will not help you through the withdrawal/detox phase. You will be referred to an inpatient rehab clinic that will charge $1400 - $2|000 per day and you will need to stay for at least 5-days!|PLEASE do you the research if you don't believe me. These medical professionals should be ashamed! ITS ABOUT PROFIT!,55-64,Male
27,27, f150stx| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,4,4,I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and was originally put on OxyContin due to other Fibromyalgia meds not effectively helping control the chronic pain.  The Original OxyContin| prior to them changing it's formulation| worked great| but after the formula was changed its effectiveness went to crap and felt like 1/4 of what it used to be so I was back to square one.||I see a pain management doctor and he recommended Methadone due to its half life| ability to control pain| and cost effectiveness.  I did my research and was worried about the horror stories I read online.  However| I went with my doctor's recommendation because I trust his experience.  ||In the end| I'm glad I made the switch to Methadone.  The monthly cost is SIGNIFICANTLY less ($10-$15 per month versus $250-$300) and I was able to experience its full effectiveness 3-4 days after starting the medication.  I experience less pain and use less breakthrough medication than what I experienced when on OxyContin..  I have been able to remain on the same dosage for over 1 1/2 - 2 years and hope to stay at the same dosage for as long as possible.||Fibromyalgia patients often get dismissed due to the inability to clearly define the root cause of the pain.  As a result| they are forced to live in pain which significantly reduces their quality of life. Everyone's body| symptoms| and effectiveness of some medications are unique.  I'm lucky and thank God every day I have a knowledgeable| empathic| and caring pain management doctor who believes / believes in his patients.  ||To everyone experiencing chronic pain .. I pray / send positive thoughts your way in hopes you find the relief you deserve to not only improve your quality of life but also to enable you to live your life to the fullest instead of just trudging through and merely surviving day by day.||Good luck and Godspeed!,25-34,Male
28,28, Cali| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,5,PEOPLE THINK THIS DRUG IS ONLY FOR ADDICTION. ITS VERY RELEVENT FOR SEVERE PAIN.  i survived a near unliveable injury and also had late stage Lyme and was in so much pain every day I wanted to die. I saw a spinal specialist and he prescribed Nucenta 50mg x 4 a day and oxycodone 15mg for breakthrough pain= 60 a month. The Nucenta was no longer covered under my insurance.  So they increased the oxycodone to 90 mg a day. I still was in a lot of pain and that fact scared me.  Then I saw a pain specialist in LA. He tried the methadone. USE CAUTION WHEN STARTING NEW MEDS- of course. But I started 5mg methadone x 2 a day in addition to OxyCodone and I was able to cut way down on my oxycodone and 9 months later even have days I skip it with increase of 10mg x 2 daily of methadone. I learned that with joint| tissue and muscoskeletal pain that a combination regimen is amazingly beneficial. Get a pain specialist. A good one. Don't stop until you have relief. Life is worth living without being incapacitated by pain. I try to eat right and walk the dogs daily. Doing great!,45-54,Female
29,29, RedSonia| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,"I have had cronic pain since i was 25 years old| I am 50. I did not start taking narcotic pain meds till i was 38. I have taken every medication known to help with cronic pain and methadone is by far the best one for me. I can live a normal healthy active lifestyle that would absolutely not be possible without it. I take 60 mgs a day | 20mgs every 6 hours. I have had to be on higher doses every once in a while (highest dose was 150mgs daily) but once the crisses passed it was fairly easy to reduce dosage. I dont feel high| dosn't make me tired after i got beyond the first couple of weeks when i first started to take for pain 6 years ago.Yes i am physically addicted to it| there is no way around that but im technically physically addicted to my heart medication as well as thyroid meds and diebetic meds also. My body physically requires all of these meds to help funtion to the best of my ability. Am i gonna stress about that fact? Absolutely NOT!! As long as i am following my Drs orders and not abuseing any of my meds the rest is the way it is. Does not make me a drug seeker or a ""druggie""| what it does make me is doing my best to cope with pain and still be a productive part of society. I wish people wouldn't lable those of us who take methadone ""addicts"" there is a HUGE difference between being physically addicted and being a ""drug addict"". I hope this helps you feel better if you were someone who was worried about being labled. Like i said| technically we are all physically addicted to whatever meds we may be taking for multiple afflictions.",45-54,Female
30,30, Tired of PAIN| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,5,5,This medication is by far the best for chronic pain.  It's not as easy to get it prescribed as it was 5 years ago.  I finally got my new pain doctor to prescribe it for me.  I was on Methadone 6 or 7 years ago| but withdrew from all pain medications.  My spine has deteriorated tremendously over the last 2 years.  So I reluctantly returned to narcotics| but Methadone helps my pain like no other.,45-54,Male
31,31, NorthwesternAlumni| 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,4,5,4,I have bone cancer as well as breast cancer.  The pain is indescribable. Since the only types of pain medicine I had ever had in my life was Tylenol and advil my doctors started me out on Norco.  That didn't do anything and so they kept upping the ante so to speak until I was on a lot of dilaudid. I was feeling like I was loosing myself and that's when my doctor suggested Methadone.  Now I know that this is ignorant and I admit I was ignorant because I thought Methadone was for drug users.  I know that it helps with that problem too| so I am not trying to come off degradingly.  After I spoke with the doctor| I spoke with my family and looked it up online.  I decided that I would trust my doctor and try it.  And I feel great considering. It doesn't make me high or loopy. It makes me still feel like me.  It takes away 90% of the pain which for someone with any severe pain would say is INCREDIBLE.  I do also take dilaudid if I have to but those days are few. I love not having to hide in bed because I am loopy.  What little life I have in between treatments is my life again as it should be and I even have more confidence with treating both cancers and its because I am able to control most of the pain.,25-34,Female

34,34, Working Man| 45-54 Male  (Patient) ,5,5,5,Although I'm new with it| I think I can accurately describe exactly how it works/feels to me. (35 mg. liquid dose): it's a famtastic anxiolytic. Does not feel like a benzodiazepine| thankfully| but Methadone does give a satisfying state of total relaxation. Barely want to move| but I say that in a nice away. I was surprised by the deeply-satisfying relaxation| because Heroin junkies say Methadone isn't much. (Then again junkies are chronic whiners). I also like the fact that Methadone's effects last for a long time. Wake up the next day still pleasantly relaxed. Pain relief I'd rate only as moderate though| I could see it being ok for mild pain| but not for severe pain. But in summary Methadone is an excellent anxiolytic.,45-54,Male

36,36, Marshanipper1| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,4,4,1,I have been on Methadone for 10 years at .5 mg x 2 times a day.  My pain doc said it was a baby dose.  I decided four months ago to withdraw. I started slowly and continued until I was down to just a small piece of the pill.  I was hospitalized one month ago and haven't had the drug since. OMG| I feel like I am having an out of body experience.  My feet| hands| lips are numb.  I can't sleep| eat or function.  I am a complete mess and didn't understand why until I read your comments.  Now that I know I will contact me pain doc and ask for another Rx to continue withdrawing. What a shame.  I never abused this drug.  Was afraid of it from the very beginning but nothing else was working.  Now you have to go to the doctor| secure the Rx| must have a diagnosis code and then| and only then will the pharmacist fill it.  She/he has the right to say NO. Will look at your controlled substance list and will determine if you need med.  The FDA makes the pharmacist file a stack of paperwork to account for your Rx.  Beware| it will be much harder to get and hard-core addicts will be buying it on the street corner. I am praying hard for relief and will continue with .25 mg a day and see what happens.  Think twice before taking this drug.  May you all be well and advised.,55-64,Female
37,37, Debrah| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,I was on oxycontin and hydrocodone for 5 years which really screwed up my mental outlook. Was switched to this med; I take 20mg four times a day and it has allowed me to have a normal life. There is no mental manipulation as before and I can be myself and live with my pain. If it weren't for this medication I think I would be a very messed up patient. Am going on my 10th year and it has been working perfectly. I won't let anyone change my meds without a fight.,55-64,Female

39,39, HappyJoyousFreeB| 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,4,5,I am 23 y/o & have battled Opioid Dependance for 7 years now. I have tried Suboxone maintenance programs| detox programs with Suboxone| detox programs with Subutex| 12 step programs| counseling| going the religious route| & just going flat out 'cold turkey'. Through all of this I had a sincere desire to sober up & change my life for the better yet I couldn't seem to stick to it for one reason or another| no matter what I did. Then I was introduced to the Methadone Clinic from a family member (Opioid Dependance/Addiction runs heavily throughout my family) and so I figured I would give it a go. I had tried everything else & realistically had nothing left to lose. I have been going for a little over two months now & have been clean and sober ever since. I'm sure a lot of people out there carry a negative stigma when it comes to Methadone Clinics & the people who go there every morning... I know I did! But little did I know it would soon become literally the only thing out there that could & would keep a needle out of my arm. I just want to throw out there that this is strictly my experience; this is what worked for me... I pray that no one else out there will struggle for as long as I did| or allow it to get to the extent that I did. But like I said| I haven't been going for long & I am already weaning down off of my original 85 mg dose. I work a 12 step program as well & my sponsor knows about everything regarding the Methadone. I used to hold a lot of guilt for taking the medication while working a 12 step program but today I know that my heart is in the right place & that I want to be 100% mind altering substance free; hence the reason I am already coming down.I just have to remember that I am not a doctor & that this will take time because I do tend to beat myself up & get ahead of myself. Overall this whole experience has benefited me immensely & I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is still suffering & knows they're ready to start living a better life.,19-24,Female

41,41, KatieJo1988| 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,4,5,"My addiction to pain pills started shortly before having surgery on my ankle in march 2012. I failed several attempts at getting clean. This time when I went to the hospital for detox I was started on methadone and the doctor talked to me about long term use of methadone| the pros and cons| so on and so fourth. Knowing how bad my addiction to opiates had gotten| I was desperate for a solution to help me get clean and STAY clean.||I was hurt in the military so even after my surgery I still had chronic pain however I was not able to control my use of the pain pills. So I needed something to help me not abuse opiates yet help with my continued daily pain as well. One of the times I tried to quit I was put on Suboxone| which made me extremely sick| found out I was allergic to it after several different trials of forms and mgs. ||This time around I started Methadone. All I can say is| METHADONE HAS CHANGED AND SAVED MY LIFE. I am able to live a ""normal"" life!!!!!!!! I am able to get up and do everyday tasks with ease| I am able to be an amazing mother to my 3 year old daughter| I am able to set goals and successfully take the steps to achieve them. I will say the task of going to the clinic everyday to get it has been a pain in the butt| although it beats chasing pain pills 24/7 365. ||Needless to say| I am VERY happy and satisfied. My main side effects are constipation| sugar cravings| extreme drowsiness and profuse sweating. There is a supplement (non prescription) that is available directly from the manufacturer to address these particular side effects. I cannot recall the name however I am trying to look it up as we speak. My clinic informed me of this supplement and has heard nothing but good things about it so as soon as I find it again I am going to order it and try it.|Methadone has a bad rep so people argue with me all the time about it| however if they haven't been in my shoes their opinion doesn't matter to me.|| Methadone saved my life.",25-34,Female

Almost 20yrs. ago I was put on Methadone to help me get off of Vicodin.

My doctor knew me before I got sick so he knew that I was not a maiingerer and has helped me through most of this time.

Although I was addicted to Heroin for 13 years and am 20 years clean I swore I would never use Methadone to get off Heroin.  I ended up on this 20 years later for chronic pain| Fibromyalgia and Hep C.  I know it is highly addictive but at this point in my life its quality over quantity and I can at least function like a normal person again.  Before this I was laid up for 2 years on my sofa depressed and gaining weight.  I lost 30 pounds within 3 months of taking this just from getting up and around again.  It does not effect my appetite but it does constipate me.  It doesnt make me sick to my stomache if I take it with out food like most pain killers.  I also take Norco (Hydrocodone) for break through pain but am getting switched over to oxycodone because of the amount of aspirin in it.  These 2 together work great and I am hoping the oxycodone will be even better.  Be very careful with this drug.  It is highly addictive and very hard to kick.

Works at keeping severe pain to tolerable levels but kills good feelings too| at least for me. Makes lots of things numb if you know what I mean. Was on other pain meds but lost feeling after starting Methadone. Bad side is if you are in horrible pain or agony| morphine or other major pain drugs from hospital is as effective as water. I was in total agony with a lodged kidney stone for approx. a week in hospital with no relief no matter the drug or the way it was given. Better have someone put you under so you can't feel the pain as nothing will relieve it. It was total hell| would rather been killed than live that pain any longer. I begged the paramedics and hospital staff to knock me out due to the pain. I have had painful tests and injections| back surgeries etc. with no pain meds many times| so I can take severe pain but this was a living hell with nothing to stop the pain till a week later the urologist finally removed the stone.

I take Norco 10/325 for break through pain and the two meds together have been a blessing.  I am is constant pain and methadone has taken my pain level from a 9.5 to 5| which is tolerable considering how much suffering I have endured.  I was apprenhensive at first but after only one dose I felt better.  My doctor and I have tried many combinations and this one works for me.

So I went to a pain doctor and he scripted methadone.  I took it for one week.  30 minutes after taking the first pill my pain was completely gone.  Little by little the first week parts of my body stop working well.  I could not hear the birds in the mourning.  I couldn't read the tv guide on the tv anymore.  I couldn't fell parts of my body.  My wife was driving me through a car wash| and it scared the life out of me| I got out of the car right in the middle of the car wash.  I stopped taking it that day| One week after I started.  My pain came back quickly| it took 2 weeks for my ears and eyes to work right again.  I had a heart attack 2 weeks later.  My heart stopped for 6 minutes| the ER notes stated the doctor told the nurse to stop trying to resuscitate me| lucky for me the nurse didn't follow directions. The heart doctor couldn't tell me why I had the heart attack.  May be the methadone may be not.  My surgeon would not give me methadone she said I was way to young at 52.  Now I know what she meant. It takes away the pain| but it also takes away your life| hearing| eye site| feeling etc.  I will never take it again.  If your in your mid 80's and are tired of the pain| then it might be for you.,45-54,Male

Also| lately I experience strange headaches that have no trigger and only last for about a minute at a time. They can be debilitating where as I cannot see. I dont know if it is from the methodone or not but Iam going to see my physician tomorrow to see why I am experiencing this. Along with headaches I deal with dizziness and anxiety here and there.

P.| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,4,5,5,In comparison with other narcotic drugs| I find that methadone is not as easily addictive as others|and I have tried most of them. Methadone has a sort of half life the following day which allows dosing to be staggered|(taken every other time)| or missed| if so desired. One can raise or lessen the dose| and gain back the effects/potentcy of the drug. Over the past 15 years I have been on and off of it and I have found it to be the most harmless.

I however went to a detox and quit taking it and took nothing I was detoxed from it in 10 days however i did not replace the methadone with anything. These ""Dr.'s"" who prescribe this medication never tell you the bad side effects of taking it. I weighed 125 lbs prior to starting the methadone before I went to treatment to get off of it I was 195lbs alot of it was water weight. I lost 28lbs the first 18 days. When you get off of this medication you feel like you have been in a coma for the entire time you have taken it. You have to relearn to function as a normal person in the world. A 30 day detox program is not the answer to detox methadone or anyone taking PRESCRIPTION drugs the CORRECT way .....exactly what your bottle says no more!!! I am only sharing from experience this is one of the worst pain medications anyone can be on.....unless you are terminally ill. The Post-Acute Withdraw from this medication can last from 3 months to a year. If you research and look at the brain of a person on methsdone ans then not taking the methadone it takes a YEAR for the brain to completely recover. Just please do your research if this is something you want to be taken off of you need to do it in a hospital or facility that knows how to taper methadone. I am off of the methadone and all pain medications and I have never had less pain.....the methadone increased my pain by 1000x.

213,213, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,2,1,I started the Methadone maintenance plan 8yrs ago. Yes it saved me from the street life I was 19 when I got on the program. I tried detox and treatment more then 10 times but I always went back to the drugs. Methadone helped me to skip the detox and not crave the drugs. Heroin and Crack. I still had to get support for leaving the life of an addict behind but that was easy. Only because I wanted to leave it. Some people are addicted to the lifestyle of a junkie| like my 30 yr old sister who now has HIV and HEP C plus |many serious infections and abscesses. What I was not told when I started the methadone program is how hard it is to get off the meth. I've been trying for years . The withdraw is worse then heroin withdraw. More pain and suffering. I recommend to do the heroin/ crack withdraw if you can. Trust me Methadone is a ball and chain to your ankle. If I could go back knowing what I know now about the program I would put up with detox and support from NA/AA. I still crave heroin and coke/crack. Especially when I am having a real hard time but I know if I go back I lose everything I have gained and done since getting clean. I was almost of the methadone until I had a sever car accident braking my neck and back. Morphine doesn't help the pain when Ur on Methadone so I had to increase my dose more than double. Just to manage the pain. Good luck to anyone who needs support best is to stay off the methadone and just get clean. It possible after a week or 2 of vomiting and aches and pains.

227,228, Southern Ladybug| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have been on this medication (off & on) for over 20 years. I have fibromyalgia associated with hep c| along with chronic back pain. Methadone has helped me to be able to do everyday routines without feeling high. I have managed to lower my dose from 100mg daily to 30mg daily. It still does the trick. People take way to much of this drug which is very dangerous. You will not get high once your are on it for at least 6 months. Clinics want to get you on as high a dose as you will allow because they know you have to have this medication. To them is all about money. Don't let this happen to you. Withdrawl from methadone is the worst of all pain meds. It can last up to 3 months to ever feel normal again. You will not sleep for 3 weeks even after all other symptoms are gone| but remember a lot of it is psychological. It does what it is supposed to do unless abused. If you can't stay awake you are taking more than you need as well if you can't sleep at night when you first begin you are also taking to much. You must build a tolerance that works for you. For me 30mg is the perfect dose to maintain| not to be taken all at once but divided in 3 doses. Once you get on it don't plan to get off. It ususlly is a lifetime medication just like insulin or high blood pressure meds. Most doctors do not know enough about this drug & therefore will not prescribe it. Like any other pain med it is addictive but can be most beneficial if used properly. It is not a drug you want to run out of...that's for sure.,55-64,Female

The big difference is that you are actually doing something really GOOD for yourself for a change. If you dont participate in your own recovery no one is going to do it for you. If you are REALLY SERIOUS about not using|you have to start somewhere. For me Methadone was the way to go. Not everyone has to STAY on this medicine forever|it is a personal choice|but it can  be used as a starting point to becoming opioid free. With the help of your clinic staff| meetings such as N.A. or A.A. and family support it is a very achievable goal.Because of Methadone I have been free from heroin addiction for many years. I began earning ""takehomes"" early on in my recovery and today I only visit my clinic 2 times a month. As a result of being on Methadone|I live a more fulfilling life all the way around. Family|grandkids|health wise|everything. I also volunteer at my clinic as an advocate for patient rights to try and give back to those who helped me.What better way to give back then to help people whose shoes I have actually walked in?? Methadone isn't for everyone|but it does help thousands of people every day to try to put a stop to the craziness of all opiate addictions. There is ALOT of misinformation out there regarding Methadone and I am here to tell you IT CAN AND DOES WORK BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE REALLY READY TO STOP YOUR ADDICTION. If you havent had enough| havent ""hit your bottom"" as they say you will probably fail at every attempt you make to stay clean.

It was a type of pain that could only be understood by those who have had kidney problems the best way would be to say it felt like I was being stabbed over and over again| repeatedly| for at least 9 hrs total a day. When I was 18| I was involved in a car accident due to a drunk driver. After the accident| I wasn't able to do anything that normal| pain free| 18 year olds could do. I couldn't even sit through an entire movie with my friends at the theater because my back pain would become so unbearable before the movie even made it half way. I was already taking Oxycontin 40mg ER| as well as the Oxycodone 15mg for the break through pain| that would come on so strong to the point where it would almost take my breath away. My pain management doctor and I discussed and agreed it was time to change my medication. Due to the natural increase in tolerance the human body eventually reaches due to long term use of one medication. That was when the doctor changed me to Methadone 10 mg. We still continued the break through pain medication. After just two days on the new medication| I had my pain rate at a 4 on the pain scale| my pain hadn't been that low on the scale since I was 13 yrs old. Methadone changed the way I was able to live my life ever since.||It makes me sick to my stomach that people who are fortunate enough NOT to need to wake up and take a pill EVERY SINGLE MORNING just to physically get out of bed EVERYDAY. To abuse medications like Methadone and get high| its terrible that so many people watch their friends and family literally killing themselves just to ""get high"". If they only realized how many of us who HAVE to take Methadone to LIVE a ""normal life"" by no choice of our own| thats just the hand we were delt.

The only thing that I really don't care for is how long it takes before the med kicks in--about 2 hours| but it does last for 12 hrs.

263,264, catwalker| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,5,4,This is the best pain medicine I have ever tried. One major problem is the very bad damage to my teeth. I was unaware this was going to be a problem. I found out way to late. I have lost and are still losing all my once beautiful perfect teeth. It happened within 8 years of starting methadose. It's a lot easier on the liver than some of the other pain meds. As with all medicine| you have to take the bad with the good and decide whats best for you. If your Dr. is good then you should be able to find the right dose for you. It may take some time to adjust to this medicine. Just be sure you don't start out on to high a dose. After I found what dose works best for me| I have never had to raise my dose in 8yrs. It is not like other meds that you get immune to and it stops working so you have to raise your dose. I get the same relief today with the same dose as I had for 8 years. And that is not something you hear said of any other pain medicine on the market that I know of. I hope this helps somebody.

I rarely need anything else for any type of pain| the methadone takes care of most things! It does come with a bad stigma attached to the name| most people still associate it with heroin addicts| but hopefully in time that will get better too! The first month or so you will have the worst of any side effects you experience. After that you won't feel any| if you're on the right dose amount! If you're too tired| you're on too much| and if you're not experiencing pain relief| you're on too little! You're body temperature will stay increased while you're on it.

I feel like me. Not the nightmare I was before. But I think that if a person has issues with dependence they would abuse it| like they will any drug. Unfortunatly a lot people end up being addicted to other pain meds because they are put on the standard narcotics for too long. Then it is all down hill from |there. If it is obviously chronic pain dr's should perscribe a drug that is proven for long term use.,35-44,Female

306,307, Dr.Gonzo| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,Methadone is a very effective medication for anyone that is severly addicted to opiates/heroin| albeit a very dangerous medication if not used properly| or abused with other drugs| especially any kind of benzodiazepines(i.e. xanax/colonopin). If you're 100% serious| and committed to getting| and staying completly clean| and abstinent from drugs| then this medication will be 100% effective in getting you clean. The only side effects that I personally have had problems with| are constipation| and moderate| to sometime severe sweating. Both of which are absolutley nothing| compared to being addicted to opiates/heroin| and living the lifestyle of an addict. I would highly recommend this medication to anyone that suffers from opiate addiction| or to family/friends that are searching for the most effective treatment for a loved one that suffers from addiction.,25-34,Male

Possibly a withdrawal symptom. The way I went off of this drug also was fairly easy&withdrawals were at a minimum I only had some hot/cold sweats on occasion. I was under my Dr.'s instruction though!

365,366, vegasrag| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,1,r pain management| methadone is extremely effective for the control of pain. And it has positive attributes that other opiod type medications lack. Such as not feeling sedated or complete euphoria all of the time and it is excellent at relieving severe pain. I personally was taking methadone for over 15 years for pain management. The longer I took the drug the more side affects I started to experience.AT THIS POINT i OFFER A WORD OF WARNING!!! Once you have become dependent on methadone it's next to impossible to get off of it. Because of the extremely long half life (up to 200 hours according to a recent study) discontinuing use of the drug can put your body in extreme danger.IF YOU MAKE THE DECISION TO USE METHADONE FOR BASELINE PAIN MANAGEMENT PLAN ON TAKING IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. When I stopped using methadone the severe withdrawal affects lasted for 6 weeks and I wasn't physically or mentally stable for at least 6 months.. I made the decision to stop taking pain medication without looking into the consequnces. Within 48 hours I had severe diareha|vomitting|anerexia|dehydration|depression and borderline suicidal tendencies. And I'm someone that would never take my own life! I collapsed and my family called 911. From this point I didn't remember the next 14 days. When the paramedics saw me they thought I had taken an overdose of methadone and injected me with a narcotic antagonist called Narcon. I immediately went into seizure. Buy the time I got to the hospital I had 2 grand mal seizures and died. Thay were able to revive me but once I was in the emergency room it occured one more time and I had to be revived again. For the next 10 days I was on life support in ICU. Once released from the hospital it took a month before I could control my bowel movements|able to feed myself|see across the room or walk without assistanse. I hope that at least one person reads this and takes it to heart. Most people end up on it for the rest of thier life.-------Rick G.,45-54,Male
366,367, kvgkegsmeg| 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,4,5,This drug has really turned my life around! Yes| it does have MANY side effects and if you are like me| the clinic is a pain to deal with. But it does get better. I have been on methadone since Feb '06 after my father-in-law overdosed on oxycontin. I am in the healthcare field and have researched extensively all the side effects and TRUE data from real trials. Most people gain weight| but that is only due to an increase in cravings for sweets| not to mention you probably weren't eating hardly anything when you were using. Constipation is a very real and sometimes bothersome side effect but I find that most people would rather be constipated than using or withdrawling. Now withdrawls are horrible. BUT if you will use the medicine like you are supposed to and slowly taper down| which may take quite a long time| you can be successful. Overdoses are NOT as common as the media likes to make it sound. 99 times out of 100 the overdose is due to interactions with other drugs| usually xanax. Also| contrary to popular belief| methadone does not get you high and most of those that need a higher dose are NOT doing it just to abuse the treatment. They normally have a high tolerance.

I had taken methadone for 5+ years for intractable chronic pain| but the side effects kept getting more and more severe.  If you are male the drug causes as much of a drop in testosterone as amputating your testicles - and this was told to me 3 years into treatment by my doctor.  He then showed me all the other meds I would need to counteract the side effects of methadone - testosterone being the least concerning.  The methadone cooked my thyroid so now I am on synthroid.  Because I have low energy on methadone I was told I would need to take anti-depressants to boost mood and energy.  This drug starts benign and gets worse and worse.

Sometimes I do have constipation| and I just in the last 4 yrs or so have been getting horrible migraines but noone can direct the blame to methadone.

I thought it was a miracle drug at first but soon changed my mind when I tried to come off of it! It is extremely hard to come off of and you have to go through the same withdrawls as other opiates just not as bad and they are monitored by the *methadone clinic*. Yes it helped at first and continues to help but some of the side affects are extremely aggravating such as constipation| weight gain| very serious interactions with other drugs such as xanax!| lack of sleep| and the price of the medication (13.00) a day and the clinic is 30 minutes from my house that at first i had to travel everyday and now i get take homes and have to go to the clinic 4 times a week but the money is the number issue as the clinic does not accept insurance! The clinic is aggravating as they only accept cash in bill form no loose change and they do not give change they put it on the books for the next day!

That's not the case at all| it is the best choice the doc did for me| and my long list of ailments. Even though it doesn't take all the pain away| it loosens me up| and ables me to move around. I have had my fair share of problems| 2 cancers| 2 chemo treatments; which left me with damages to my hands and feet| DDD; degenerative disc disease| arthritis| spinal fusion in neck| herniated disc| protruding disc| other choice ailments. Doc said my back would never be pain-free. |I am lucky| I'm still here by miracle. And it has been easier taking the Methadone| I was relieved I had no withdrawls| and no side effects| Methadone| I call it the stealth pain killer| you really don't feel it| and it is so smooth with no complications it made me a happy camper| not even the mood swings or irritability.|My Oncologist made the best choice for me.,45-54,Female

503,504, PSAD| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,5,5,"I fear this drug gets a lot of negative attention| so much so that a large percentage of dr's (whom I have talked to) will not even prescribe the medication.  Most think it is a drug used for drug additics| to help their drug withdrawel symtomps from illegal drugs easier to cope with; which it is used for in methadone clinics for meth addicits and of course in all kinds of drug treatment programs.  But it is also an excellent pain relivier for people who are opiate tollerent and have tried most of the other pain relievers (both prescribed and over the counter).  I have cancer| Reflex System Dystrophy a.k.a. CRPS| and Fibromyalgia.  I have used prescription pain killers for the past 17 years.....with a ""cure"" break of about 2-3 years with zero to minimal pain medications.  My physicians started me on everthing you can imagine over the counter| and then went the start of what has fealt like an endless line of prescribtion drugs.  To make a longer story a bit shorter I still have all the above list disease and last year found Fentanyl (100mcg) Pain Patches to be a great relief from pain| with Percocet 10/325 used for breakthrough pain only.  But as of 2010| the patches fell off my preferred drug list and were only covered at a certain percentage; which might not have been so bad| but the cost of each 100mcg patch was around $50 each.  I was prescribed one every other day with a monthly retail price of around $600-$700 (depending on pharmacy and if they were willing to help me and give me the patches at what the insurance companies get them for).  Therefore| I am now on a very great medication that is around $70.00 a month for 540 tablets a month called Methadone.  I am taking 6 10mg tablets three times a day| which is a MAJOR MAJOR dose.  For anyone with insurance the cost is probably under $10.  *WARNNANY. This drug is highly addicitive| as are all codeine| morphine| etc drugs.

527,528, krandy| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,I think methadone has gotten a bad rap from most health officials. If you mix this with other types of street drugs or stronger binzos such as xanax|valuim|atavan|they are at a higher risk of death. You can't blame the pill you must look in the mirror and put the blame on yourself by over doing your dose.Methadone has a 24 hour half life and when used like your Dr. prescribed| you have nothing to worry about. I know because this drug saved my life 12 years ago and I still take the correct dose that is prescribed for my pain. No other drug worked for me but methadone.

587,588, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,3,4,I began taking methadone 16 months ago due to severe long-term addiction to oxycontin. During active addiction I was diagnosed with MS and now have chronic headaches due to herniations and bulging of disks in my neck on top of nerve endings that feel like they are on FIRE! Methadone has been a blessing in helping me with my addiction and relieving ALOT of the pain. However| my heartbeat has slowed and there is evidence of arrythmia. I am finally settled on a dose and have just stopped taking benzos (another no no for those on methadone). My question to the readers of this post is| based on my pain relief and getting through the addiction issues. What would you think of my continuing treatment given the heart problem?  Since being weaned off of the benzos and other depression meds| my heartbeat averages @ 60 bpm at age 42 with some signs of arryhthmia. My heart rate fell to an average of 42 bpm 5 months ago with all of the other  meds on top of methadone. Given all of this| has anyone else had the same problems and what should I do?  I'd like to continue use but the heart thing scares me even though it is coming back to normal. I'm tired of addiction and tired of pain. Methadone works well for both and neither my cardiologist or neurologist have suggested discontinuation of this med at this time. What would any of you recommend?  Serious answers only.,35-44,Female

607,608, mandyjuelz| 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have been taking methadone for 3 yrs almost and it has been a lifesaver!  I was shooting $400.00 a day worth of oxycontin| fentanyl| and heroin in my arm and I had lost everything I had worked for by the age of 21.  I began the program at the methadone clinic just because I could no longer afford my habit.  I still continued to use when I first started the program.  But| then after a while| I realized that methadone was working fine and that I didn't have to use anymore.  Because of methadone| I have rekindled relationships with my friends and family (who now trust me again)| I've got a wonderful job and my own house and car.  I have to start over from scratch at 22 yrs. old| but I'm so glad I did.  If you take this drug the way it is prescribed and actually make an attempt to follow the program| then it will work and it will change your life. I would be dead if it weren't for this miracle drug.  Yes| withdrawal from methadone is awful and worse than heroin withdrawal| but if you follow the program correctly and SLOWLY taper down the way you are supposed to then you won't experience any of this horrible withdrawal.  You hear people talk about how horrible this drug is because of the severe withdrawal| well if they would have follwed the program right| instead of continuing to still get high and get kicked off the program| then they wouldn't experience this bad withdrawal.  People who continue to get high while on the program are the people that give methadone rehabilitation a bad stigma.  Also| you hear people talk about how they'd like to have methadone taken off the market b/c their loved ones od'ed| etc.  Well| 9 times out of 10| it' because they were probably abusing it| not taking it they way it was prescribed| or because they mixed it with another narcotic.  I wish people would realize how many lives this drug has SAVED....including mine. With it| you get less addicts| less people stealing| less transmitted disease from IV use| etc.  It's a miracle drug!,19-24,Female

I told my primary care  doctor and the perscribing doctor that this medicine is not helping anymore and that its making me very tired. My primary doctor said maybe taking methadone with daladid or morphine or oxy cotten would be more helpful | later that day seeing my pain doctor she said she will not do that and upped my dose from 12.5 max to 17.5 mg daily???  I dont understand why my doctor is not listening to my complaint of this medication. Does anyone know of a better pain clinic/pain Dr.  in the Rochester|Ny  area.

626,627, jesthro| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,4,5,3,"I have had 4 open shoulder reconstructive surgeries.  Aside from the daily shoulder pain I have| back problems aswel.  I take 40 mg of methadone per day| 2 daily| and 2 before bed. Other than severe episodes of drowsiness| which go away after a 30 min nap| I find that this medication works very well for me.  Before taking methadone| I was taking 10 mg percocets every 6 hours for pain management.  I found that the percocets kept me up at night| and soon they didn't work aswel as they were at first do to tolerance biuld up.  I also found that when I started taking methadone for pain after I had been taking the percocets| I no longer would have anxious episodes in between my percocet doses| kind of like tiny withdraw episodes because the percocet would only last me 3 hours after a while.  I found myself suffering for 3 hours in between my regular every 6 hour doses.  The methadone has a longer half life| which means it works longer for the pain then the other drugs I have taken for pain do.  I no longer have anxious| pain filled fits inbetween my methadone doses.  The only thing that I experience once in a while is a bit of mild pain while sleeping at night| do to moving around on my shoulders.  My mood is better! my pain is 80% better! my appetite is back to normal.

631,632, EJ| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,I've been on chronic pain meds for about 13 years.  I started on oxycontin but after 5 years I began to notice that I was forgetting things and I was always so tired.  My family was concerned about my forgetfulness and the constant sleeping as well.  My doctor switched me to Methadone and thank God.  I am clear headed| the pain is not completely gone but I didn't expect it to be.  I learned a long time ago that there is really nothing that will take the pain away 100%| and once I dealt with that and changed my expectations| I found the methadone to be the best drug for me.  I use oxycodone daily for occasional flare ups in my pain level.  My biggest struggle has been finding and keeping a doctor who will prescribe the high dosage of medication I need to be able to function.  I went on disability 10 months ago and thought my pain level would go down due to the change in my activity level. It didn't| so again I had to change my expectations.

I've been prescribed a host of medications throughout the years - muscle relaxers| Tylenol w/Codeine| Vicodin|  Percocet| and OxyContin| to name a few. ||A few years ago| my doctor and I discussed the possibility of switching my pain medication to Methadone. After we discussed the benefits v. drawbacks| I decided to give it a shot since none of my prior meds worked to my satisfaction. ||I have found that| in my case| this medication is far superior to others for a number of reasons. It helps me deal with my pain while allowing me to function in a normal manner. My tolerance has not increased in the 3+ years I've been using this med| as compared to all the others. The dose is long acting| plus I don't need to take as much to relieve my pain. I am also able to sleep at night (for once!)| and don't wake up groggy or fuzzy the next day. ||This medication takes a few days to get into your system properly| so don't be impatient and exceed your dose. As it cannot be refilled over the phone at your neighborhood pharmacy| if you run out before your next appt. you may experience some degree of opiate withdrawal. Rather than go 'cold turkey'|  you can probably take a little less for a few days in order to build up a supply to help you thru til your next appt. Use common sense.||Methadone can be a helpful medication if taken properly. A proper dialogue between doctor and patient is necessary in order to find the proper dose and minimize complications.

664,665, OGBJ| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,This medication works very well for me. I have been on it for over a 25 yr. period off & on. It works longer and will not destroy your teeth or bones if you follow proper oral hygiene & simply take care of yourself. I personally feel that no one  needs more than 60 mgs. daily. It is a blocking dose & will prevent other narcotics from working properly. Benziods do not mix with methadone & will kill you very quickly. If you take this drug for the proper reasons it will work very well for you. If you are abusing it I can assure you; you will not do it for long. It only takes that one time to take away a persons life. You can not take it back. This is not something one should play around with| this is a deadly serious drug that only works when taken with proper precautions and the person is trying to get well & not get high.,45-54,Female

When it wasn't effective| I was then put on Morphine and Celebrex. After having side effects with the Morphine| he then switched me to Methadone. I have had to increase the dosage over the years| but all in all I feel that Methadone works very well. I am able to drive| study| concentrate| and converse very well. In fact| if I am in pain| I am unable to carry on a conversation with people| and am unable to function. There have friends and family who have assumed my lack of concentration was due to the medication| when it is actually the opposite. One thing I am a bit concerned about is that since I have been on this medication for 8 years| are there risks and/or side effects that I should be aware? Also would it be better to switch opioids when it isn't as effective rather than increasing the dosage? If anyone knows the answers to these questions| I would be grateful if you would share this information with me.,45-54,Female

I only wish people would not blame their inadequacies on methadone and rather be honest about why treatment failed for them.

It's not a quick fix.. It takes time to wean off properly.  You should go as slow as possible.  i have nothing but good things to say about this drug and my clinic.

For as long as I have been taking Methadone now I can say that nothing works better for my pain than yhis drug and before I my Doctor started me on this we tried several other pain drugs but I either had to take so many or they never controlled the pain for long and was always having break through pain and then would have to take other pain meds to stop that.

My insurance company says getting my medication every 30 days should not be an issue since my pharmacy knows that I get it every month. I guess the insurance company doesn't deal with real pharmacies. I have never had any pharmacy offer to give me any narcotic for any reason what-so-ever without a current written prescription from my MD. A couple of years ago there was a Spring storm that knocked down the phone/elec lines and there was no communication from my MD for over 7 days.

The first day on this medication| I felt like a teenager again| each day after the less effective it was for my pain and it was down hill from that point.  I am aware that when a patient is put on this drug that one should be monitored daily for 2 weeks for blood pressure declines.  Within the first week of taking this drug| I was in the ER 3 times and was told that if I continued taking this medication| I would DIE.  I contacted my pain doc who ignored my calls and ignored the 7 lbs. of fluid that was in my feet.

I went to college| became a RN| got married| raised children. I do not use other drugs nor drink.|While Methadone is a good alternative|  a solution to Heroin's addiction| I have to say I honestly believe this is due to Heroin being an illegal drug and Methadone being a legal one. |Use of Methadone not just to detox but as long term maintenance potentially precludes both the physical danger/risk and the social; such as HIV| AIDS| and overdose| and via needles| also abscess| infection| sepsis| amputation of limbs. Than there's also obvious social risks avoided such as arrest and incarceration| involvement with crime and unsavory people in general| loss of: employment| a house/housing| a love life and there is an impact on relationships in general. |However... Methadone is far far harder to get off. I could and did stop Heroin. Going cold turkey was not a big deal. I went cold turkey maybe 40 ?? times. I would stay clean. The problem was I always eventually went back. |I am terrified of Methadone withdrawal. I am on 110 mg. and I believe there is a good chance I would have seizures or die if inadvertently I was somehow unable to get my dose. Methadone withdrawal is far more serious| more intense.

724,725, [emailÂ protected]| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,"I have many years experience in the medical field. I have a degenerating spine and have had 2 surgeries.  It started with my cervical spine (now fused) and now my lumbar spine has another disc that is herniated.  It causes me severe pain all day and night.  Without pain medication I  have to stay in bed all the time. I have taken Methadone for the past 4 years and it has managed the pain well. I am able to cook| clean and do some gardening while taking this medication. It is inexpensive and easy to take.  After a move to the south last year| I found that Drs here are very reluctant to prescribe this medication. Even with my 20 years of medical records in hand| no one would fill my medication. I had to go to a ""pain clinic"" which was a nightmare.  They count your pills as if you were an addict and make you give urine tests every month. It was dirty and very unorganized. If you can't give a urine sample on the spot....they ""drop"" you.  Unbelievable.  So now I find myself on Oxycodone which does not work well| doesn't last as long and costs almost $200.00 for a 1 month supply. A far cry from the $40.00 for Methadone. I should have stayed in California. They are 20 years behind time here.",55-64,Female

But if you ever go to move PLEASE find a doctor where your moving to BEFORE you move !!!!!!! I moved from FL. to S.C. and didn't think there would be a problem and boy was I wrong ! I had to go through withdraws. At first I thought I was just sick to begain with and I have never been through anything like that before. I went a month having to go to the hospital for pain relief. So other than having a problem when I moved I would tell anyone that needs it and takes it like the doctor says it is a great pain med and you don't have to take more and more of it over time like all the other meds I've taken. |P.S.

Most clinics keep odd hours like banks so if you're a ""night person"" you better get unused to that routine. Most clinics are closed by noon and close much earlier on weekends.|I've been on it 6 years and have run the gauntlet of side effects from dizziness to severe constipation to heart problems to mystery pains. |Withdrawing from methadone has proven to be nearly impossible and some clinicians seem to have a God complex with the ability and many with the overwhelming desire to control patients lives through not only bad counseling| but threats of being taken out of treatment to removal of takeouts to many other forms of degrading treatment including| but hardly limited to constant observed urine screenings even after having been clean for well over 3 years.|I have few problems with the drug itself| but do have problems with clinic staffs who often abuse patients with impunity almost to the point where many staff members see themselves as little more than prison guards with no signs of caring or desire to see improvement in patients lives.|If you chose to be on methadone be careful which clinic you go to.

789,790, Jacklonl| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have had chronic pain for decades| always treated with opiates| which I did not like to take because of the side effedts| e.g.| brain fuzziness| lack of concentration| no desire to do ANYTHING! Methadone has been a life saver!!! I cannot stress enough how well it has helped me with my chronic pain| and I only use morphine for 'breaktrough pain.' This drug has given me my life back. NOT TO EXAGGERATE BUT IT HAS GIVEN ME MYSELF BACK. I do not feel drugged. I feel clear-headed and as much as a 'normal' person can feel. The goal for me is to live a full and active life without having to resort to my breakthrough medication. I have suggested this to my Mother who suffers evey day from severe| completely debilitating chronic pain| but her doctor refuses to give her methadone but oxycodone instead. (That drug made me CRAZY)! Two friends have chronic debilitating pain| but their doctors refuse to help them off their opiates and on to methadone.  I feel like shouting from the rooftops that it is truly a wonder drug for chronic pain and will give yourself back to you. I truly believe that doctors now need to be educated that methadone is a wonder drug compared to having a patient on opiates for years. DOCTORS ARE HOLDING PEOPLE BACK FROM FEELING PAIN RELIEF!!!!! and ignore all the stigma associated with this drug! Thank you for allowing me to get on 'my soapbox' and in this way| I am shouting from the rooftops!  Thank you.  Jacklon Stanley| Greenfield| IA,55-64,Female

Even taking sleeping pills it doesn't put him to sleep and therefore it seems like he is over medicated when he only is allowed up to 6 per day and sometimes only takes 4.

814,815, unaddicted :)| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,3,5,I used to take OxyContin 120 mg per day.  I was completely addicted. My dr put me on methadone not only did it ease my headaches there were no horrendous withdrawels if I skipped a dose. Frequently I cut back and go off it for a while to assure myself I can. If you cut back slowly there are no withdrawls not like the horrible ones I would get with OxyContin to the point I thought I was dying.  If you are addicted to opiates I strongly recommend the use of this medicine for getting clean.,35-44,Female

If I do| I am unable to sleep and will be wide awake until around 2-3a.m. That makes for a terrible next day. In addition to taking the Methadone| I have to take a muscle-relaxant for severe muscle spasms. I am very happy with how the Methadone has helped with chronic pain.,35-44,Female

Then I was put on darvacet| lortab and muscle relaxers.(not at the same time)  Still nothing helped with the severe pain in my right leg and lower back.  Now I am taking methadone pills every 12 hours and it seems to be helping.  Right after sitting down at the computer for half hour or so I could not get up without help| now I can get up still with pain but not nearly as much.

During this time I have had 2 babies. My first baby was born 13 weeks premature (which had nothing to do with my methadone use). He's now a perfectly healthy 16 month old. My second baby was a healthy 6 pounds and 3 ounces. She stayed in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for about 6 weeks. The doctors put her on very| very low doses of Morphine for Methadone withdrawals. Then they detoxed her off of the morphine slowly. She's now 3 months old and doing great. I know that we are now addicted to methadone but it's better than what we were doing before treatment. We're not always chasing a pill| dealing with bad people in bad places| breaking the law| spending all of our money (and everyone else's for that matter)| lying to the people that care about us| risking overdosing| or any other problems from being unstable on different medications that we weren't prescribed to. We're now on a stable dose that is managed by a doctor and is legal. We take regular drug screens| go to meetings| and meet with our own assigned counselors regularly. Everything is not ""all better now"" and probably never will be because we are addicts. But I can say that we both have had great benefits from this program. But everyone is different and I would also recommend to anyone that is considering this drug for maintenance treatment that they take their time and do their research and think about it seriously.

Today I am 1 yr clean from methadone!I have never abused a drug in my life before methadone. My legalized drug dealer(my pain doc) put me on this horrible drug after I became tolerant to every other drug for my back pain. Of course he never told me it would seep into my bones and ruin my teeth. Best of all he never told me if I tried to take myself off this horrible med i would want to kill myself| horrible withdraw like no other you cant possibly imagine the feeling. So after many attemps of detoxing at home i checked myself into rehab. 21 days| yes 21 LONG HORRIBLE DAYS OF DETOX!!!!!!! I will tell you what anyone who has been through detox of any street drug| this is just legalized herion.  YES| you are better off putting a needle in your arm then putting this poison into your body. herion is the lesser of two evils. If you dont beleive me read anything that comes up on the internet or better yet call any rehab or drug counsler and they will be very happy to let you know what is the truth. bottom line| yes it is very much my fault for abusing this drug but why wasnt i told or warned anything about the side effects and what would happen when i finally woke up and wanted my life back. I WAS TOLD NOTHING!!!! If nothing i wrote made you think| think about this| why does it take an average person on the same mg 5-7 days to detox from herion and methadone is 19 to 30. or better yet next time you see your doc ask them what post accute withdraw from methadone means. See if they tell you its when you think your done detoxing and the medicine that has made a home in your bone marrow seeps out and you start the process all over again! Good luck!,25-34,Female

The phantom pains were excruciating until i was prescribed methadone- it was as if it came from heaven. At first it didn't work because i was unaware of the need for a 3x a day regiment (they told me about it but i thought it was optional). Once i started the regiment it worked wonders. Now I am trying to get off of it but has been considerably difficult. It's a narcotic so the withdrawals have been intense| but i've gone down to once every other day after a month of taking less and less.  |It has helped with the Phantom pains in ways Oxycodone and Percocet couldn't.

I was put on methadone for opiate withdrawals| however I found that with my addictive personality with pain meds| I got addicted to methadone too.  BUT...I FOUND THE MIRACLE DRUG---SUBOXONE!!  Suboxone has saved my life| I can now go on living my day without worrying about where I'm going to get my next methadone (because I ended up taking more than what I was supposed to so I could get ""high""...)

It takes the withdrawal symptoms of any opiate or heroin away and suppresses any cravings and allows you to go on with your life and enjoy the things you used to enjoy before this addiction took over your life.  Believe me....I know how bad withdrawals are off of heroin| hydrocodone| oxycontin| and methadone...SUBOXONE KICKS ITS A#%... HOPEFULLY THIS WILL HELP SOMEONE OR ALOT OF ADDICTS OUT THERE THAT HAVE RAN OUT OF OPTIONS| OR HAVE NO HOPE LEFT.

Methadone is the only pain med that has not built a rapid tolerance in fact after 3 years I still take the same dosage and it works. I have 5 compression fractures to the spine| one shot knee| Sciatica in the other leg. I cannot get out of bed until I take my morning medication. Now the reason I am responding| getting off of this drug| I was arrested on a 12 year old warrant and ended up in a Nazi run county jail| I had scripts for both Methadone and Roxycodone| they ""lost"" the Methedone and gave me hit and miss doses of the oxycodone so effectively I went through Methedone withdrawal in a jail cell with diahrreah| etc. it took about 6 or 7 days to get past the methadone but they were killing me by not giving me my Roxicodone on a regular schedule| I would start to feel human and then the Nazis would forget or lose my pill| etc. I came up about 30 pills short when I finally got out after 14 days of legal acrobatics. All in all the severe pain was the worst part| I have no sympathy for those who take this drug for addiction relief| it was invented by Nazi Germany in WWII to replace morphine and it is the only thing they did right. It works and if you are in real pain and don't abuse it| it is the best there is and I have tried them all.|People that die from OD are usually new to the drug and don't take the warnings seriously| or they buy it on the street and think it is just another codone so if 1 is good 4 must be great| right?

924,925, SouTexJD| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,4,4,1,I was crushed by 3 tons several years ago and had reconstructive knee and back surgery.  I took methadone for pain caused by severe nerve damage.  It worked for the first three days but on the forth day things got very interesting... when I woke up I literally was unable to move due to muscle weakness. When I did manage to get some strength I had to deal with the WORST headaches I have ever experienced (and I have migraines and cluster headaches)as well as severe tremors.  I thought I was dying.  Then to top it all off i got a nifty rash from this stuff.  Prior to me taking this as part of a pain management program I had been on numerous other pain meds.  It does work but watch out for the side effects and allergic reactions.  I hate having to take opioads for pain but at least I am able to function.  Methadone made me bed ridden for 16 days - my doctor took me off of it after day five and stuck me in the hospital for observation.  Not only did I have to deal with side effects and allergic reaction but on top of that it prevented other pain medication for working properly.  If you have no reaction to it I know it relieves pain but make sure you monitor yourself when you start methadone. As for its other uses I can say that methadone saved a relative from heroine addiction and certain death.,25-34,Male

Nothing else worked. While people who really look for relief from pain| others looking for a high just might die. The time it stays in the body is long term| and people who take it to get high usually can die. I've seen reports where just 1 pill kills.

I've gone from 120mgs to 25mgs & hope to be off by this time next yr.MMT is the only thing that has ever worked for me with regards to my disease [addiction] for those of you who think people in mmt aren't in recovery please educate yourselves for those of you who think you can never get off you can.

958,959, rrredhd| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,3,3,I have RA & Fibromyalsia| nothing was working anymore and we were talking about opiate use. Methadone changed my life! I take 30 mg 3X daily on my worst day| it has been very slowly climbing in tolerance levels but I have been on it over 4 yrs now and aside from being sick of having to take pills every day...I can bend| cook| wash dishes| bathe myself and drive as long as I watch my dosage. It doesn't have the long term tolerance problem I had with vicodan and lortab and even percocet. It holds alot longer| and I have been able to live again. I couldn't bend down| squat| get up from a squat| climb stairs or climb into a car or tub before my methadone treatment. I recommend this therapy for all those who have terminal pain that need something forever. The methadone along with ibuprofen is almost a miracle cocktail if you don't have problems with hepatitus C or liver problems. I do tire of pill popping| it almost gags me and I would love to be able to just dose myself with a patch or something along that line| that would make it as perfect as I could ask for.,45-54,Female
960,961, Leanne| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,4,2,3,I started methadone to replace oxycontin use and i have somewhat chronic pain and bad headaches. I have been on methadone for 1 year and 6 months. I am 35 years old. I am unmemployed due to depression and anietxy. My mehtadone dose is 280 mg which i take in the late morning and it is good for 24 hours.  I also have tylenol #4 for breakthru pain.  I have trouble with the taste of the methadone and drinking it gags me!  I also get quite tired in the afternoon and usually end up taking a nap or two.  I do find I sweat alot. Sometimes I wonder if maybe I should stop taking it? But it does work so why would I| i guess.  I did read on this website about another drug called subutex and was quite interested in it but don't know much about it. So for now I'll stick with what's working even thought I can't stand the taste and it makes my stomach nasusa.  It keeps the pain somewhat at bay| not my headaches though. It does keep the cravings for opiates away.,35-44,Female

I also take percocet twice a day. I suffer from chronic pain in both feet for the past 25 years| and have recently been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis along with it.

I only have 3 discs left total in my back and neck.  As long as I take as directed I would say it keeps the edge off of my pain 75% of the time| however my pain is so severe| I do think it is time for an increase.  It is a great drug| but not one to enter into lightly.  It can cause you to itch in hot sunlight or extremely hot days| and I want to sleep and awful lot.,45-54,Female

I have severe fibromyalga along with spinal stenosis| degenerative disc disease| and arthritis in both knees so bad that I often have to use a walking stick or cane. I take 70 mg a day usually in 3 doses and this allows me to continue working and to take care of my home. While I no longer can work as a sales rep I can work in the documment dept. since the Methadone does not give me a fog or high associated with other pain meds. My condition had gotten so bad that I was having problems getting in and out of my car and rarely got through an entire day without leaving early.

Methadone is not anymore difficult to ""get off of"" than heroin| percocet|oxys|etc..actually its easier.If you have self control and want to live drug free I would recommend this medication to anyone.It is far better than the alternative.Maybe methadone may not be for everyone| we are all individual but if you work with the medication| the medication will work for you.",35-44,Female

982,983, coyablue2| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,4,"I suffer from severe Fibromyalgia as well as degenerative disc disease. It took about 10 - 14 days| but following this time frame| (i.e. once the methadone had a chance to build up in my system)|I found it more effective than any other pain drug treatment that I had tried.  And| I've pretty much run the gammet over the past 25yrs.  I was leary in the beginning| I must admit| especially with the reputation that goes along with it.  However| overall I find it to be long lasting (without the typical ""roller-coaster"" affect)| that goes along with most opiod drug treatments; as well as being easy to use. I realize that opiods are very often frowned upon for the treatment especially of fibromyalgia. Therefore| I can really only of course speak from my own positive experience.  Like any chronic pain condition| and mainly with fibromyalgia| eating a well balanced diet| stretching and incorporating mild exercise into your lifestyle is as important to follow through with as the use of whatever prescription medication your doctor has prescribed. And last but not least| while treating your pain with methadone it is extremely important to make sure you get at least a full 8 hours of sleep a night| often with intergrating 1-2 small naps per day as needed.   With methadone| as in the case of any opiod pain management drug treatment| it is essential to take this particular medication exactly as directed.  If you feel that you are experiencing break-through pain that the methadone is not addressing| talk to your doctor about a possible alternate drug for breakthrough pain.  Do not increase your dosage of methadone on your own.  I feel that methadone can| and is for me with my chronic pain issues| a very effectife medication when taken as directed.",35-44,Female

1005,1006, MM| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have been on pain medications for years now due to cancer and complications from cancer and chemotherapy/surgery.  I have taken several different types of pain medication including Oxycontin 160mg| MS Contin 100mg| Fentanyl patches 150 mcg| Dilaudid 4mg| and MS IR 15mg.  Eventually I was so tolerant to opiates that nothing worked.  My Oncologist referred me to a Pain Clinic where I was prescribed Methadone 20mg four times per day.  The difference has been phenomenal!  I get much more pain relief with almost no side effects.  Methadone provides pain relief without the euphoria and the roller coaster ride of highs and lows that the other opiates cause.  It amazes me that Methadone still carries such a negative connotation in society| especially in the Medical community.  Physicians continue to be afraid to prescribe Methadone for pain even in cancer patients and other patients with extremely painful conditions.  Methadone is an excellent drug and very inexpensive compared to other opiates which are much less effective.  Hopefully| one day soon| Methadone will no longer be Taboo in our society and suffering patients will be able to obtain Methadone without being treated like drug seeking junkies.,35-44,Male

Methadone gives me a chance of having a chance to have as close to a normal life as possible without surgery. At first I was scared to try it cause of all the bad things I have heard about it. But if u take it as prescribed it really works.Those people who overdose on methadone are not taking it right| they are mixing it with other meds without Dr. approval or they are just using it to get high.I've been on other pain medication| but none has even come close to taking away as much pain as the methadone.People that are abusing it is making it hard for people who really need it. I take my first dose before I even get out of bed| it takes about 45 to 50 minutes for it to work. then I can get up and start my day with a clear head and as close to pain free as I have ever experienced with all the other pain meds that i have been perscribed.

1030,1031, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I was in a serious accident and put on percocet for pain.  I was on the percocet for several months.   When I was no longer in pain I stopped taking the medication I suffered from withdrawl.  I began drug seeking and continued for several years.  I am now on methadone for treatment and I have never felt better.  I dont get high from the drug and the withdraw is gone.  I am an avid supporter of methadone programs for opiate dependence and suggest anyone who is an opiate addict try this treatment.  For those seeking pain relief| methadone is a long acting drug with a half life.  It does work for pain but your body determines how well it will work.  Talk to your doctor about other pain medications.  If it is for long term pain| withdraw from methadone is alot easier to deal with than say percocet or oxycodone|  I highly advise all narcotic pain med users to find a new type of drugs| narcotics are dangerous and lead to addiction if abused or used for long periods of time.  AI's work just as well for most types of pain| I have used both many times for the same type of pain and the AI's always win out in relief.   Methadone is great for opiate addicts but in my opinion| any narcotic is too much for pain relief as well as too dangerous.,25-34,Male

So I was sick of feeling like a junkie on top of my severe pain issues. Methadone has given me my life back. There has been no side effects like on opiates and I take about 15 mg a day vs. 60-80mg a day of percocet. This is amazing I even tried suboxone| but it didn't control my pain and didn't stop the physical craving for the drugs every few hours or so despite the need for it due to pain.

I still have to deal with pain but at a level I can tolerate instead of constant pain. I take less of this then I would have had to take of any other pain meds. I take up to 15 mgs a day and have for over 31 months chronic lower back-pain and there are days the pain causes me to not be able to walk or stand so having this to help ease the pain is a Blessing. I really hate when I see a new Doctor and they ask if I am  a drug-addict or an alcoholic all because I take methadone for pain| they should think before saying something to insulting a person that lives with chronic pain daily. You would think that a doctor would know what else this is used for besides Heroin users or drug-addicts,45-54,Female
