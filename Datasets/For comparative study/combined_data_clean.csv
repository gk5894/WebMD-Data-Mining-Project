5,5, Ned| 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,2,5,2,"I've been taking pain meds for 40 years due to a industrial accident in 1978. I didn't start the methadone until 25 years ago| they started me on 40mg a day worked very good. After a auto accident| A different Doctor moved me up to 120mg because of a neck injury for around 6 years then decided to start taking me down to 40 mg a day. I was getting by with that and a breakthrough med| but wasn't able to get out and enjoy the things I did when on the higher dose. The middle of this month ""Aug"" he tells me he's not going to give me anymore methadone or breakthrough meds because of a new law that was passed a few months back. Now I am having restless legs| pain has came back| no sleep for 4 nights| so I'm in a heck of a mess now. Tried to get in a pain management| they said he should have referred me. Don't know what to do next. It gets worse every day. If you have a doctor| that will offer it| and you and need it| it works very well.",Methadone,65-74,Male
7,7, Sunnygrl2015| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have had much pain relief from using methadone. I just do not like going to a Methadone Clinic on a daily basis to get my daily dose. I can't get take homes because I am a pot smoker| which also helps with the pain as well.,Methadone,35-44,Female
8,8, awakeandaware| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,1,1,1,ASCEND LABS ASC 116 (generic) methadone 10mg are awful! been on methadone 10 plus years and now forced to take generic ascend labs never felt so bad! why is ascend labs allowed to produce such a crappy form of methadone with LOADS of side effects!!!! NO good! been so successful in treatment until NOW... please take these off the market they will help with opiate abuse prevention ..,Methadone,35-44,Female
10,10, SCGiants| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,5,3,I have chronic back pain from numerous causes. I have been going to pain mgmnt for a decade now and started off w/ NSAIDS an worked up from there... hydrocodone| oxy... time released morphine pills| then Fentanyl patches (which almost killed me when a 3 day patch was released into me within an hour as my work was over 100 degrees and I was pouring sweat (heat released... as I later learned!). I didn't like living like a zombie tho. Dr. gave me Methadone to try and it was like a miracle drug at first. Took away all the pain except break thru pain and after a week I was used to it and felt no high or anything like that. Dr originally said it was safe even at high amounts. I was up to 120 mg/day (12 -10mg pills/day) 7 years later I HATE it as I believe it is killing me. I have lost all drive 100%| I get shaky from doing nothing at all|  ambition is all gone and I was highly ambitious and a hard worker... I cannot work anymore (I am 44 yrs old)| constantly fatigued| exhausted| pain is now all back and I am being weaned to half the dose to get to 60mg a day as they learned that anything over that greatly increases the chance for serious heart problems! My life is hell. My free testosterone level dropped to 40... should be 400... (read up on low testosterone levels). They gave me adderall to counter the constant exhaustion| which screwed w/ sleep and now I take ambien to sleep! It is a one way ticket to hell this stuff and I wish I never started it. It is the WORST possible drug to get addicted to as it is the worst to come off of and it has taken me over a year just to drop 40mg/day and every day is pure hell to live. DO NOT start this drug! I cannot stress enough how bad it is in the long run. I also believe it has screwed with my pineal gland and caused me to get Fibromyalgia which I never had any of the symptoms before. I honestly feel as if I am dying inside. I don't even have the energy to file for Disability and even showering daily seems like a huge undertaking.,Methadone,35-44,Male
12,12, Lady59 chimo6| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,3,4,3,Was on this for about 6 yrs.| wasn't helping even with increased dosage. Dr decided to change my pain meds. I weaned off the methadone slowly & started noticing my legs no longer felt tight ( spasms| spasticity ) was very surprised that was the reason my legs hurt so all the time.,Methadone,55-64,Female
14,14, Pain is LAME| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,5,I think Methadone is by far the best medication for chronic pain.  I was suicidal before being prescribed Methadone| and now the pain is much improved.  Saved my life.  I just hope people realize that not everyone abuses their pain medication.,Methadone,45-54,Male
16,16, catlover123| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,5,4,Methadone is an excellent medication for deep set acing pain and| in my experience| only somewhat effective for sharp pain. It is easy to use and does not fog up the mind as much as other strong schedule 2 narcotics do. I recommend a chronic pain patient to give it a try if you are unsatisfied with your current pain medications.,Methadone,55-64,Male
18,18, ladyhummingbird| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,My pain is chronic and severe. Mornings are the worst and at night it will awaken me. I take my methadone and it takes the pain from 10 down to 2. I have no bad side effects of any kind although I take the pill form 10mg.,Methadone,55-64,Female
19,19, HeatherGo| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,My husband and I were in a car accident in October 2001| from which I am now paraplegic. Within a few months of my accident| I began having horrible pain in my hips. I was diagnosed with chronic pain due to Heterotopic Ossification| or bone growing in my hip joints. I started seeing a pain management doctor and for like two months he tried me on everything imaginable and nothing| NOTHING worked. I ended up going back in the hospital for other reasons and they started me on methadone and finally I had relief! It wasn't complete relief but I was able to function and live again. Since I first began taking it| doctors have decreased it| I currently take 40mgs three times a day along with Neurontin and Percocet and I've found that taking the three medicines together is what works the best for me. I still have my bad days| like we all do I'm sure| but I am just so very thankful that I found a combination that works well for me and gives me relief enough to be able to get out and live life| happily. This medicine has truly been a Godsend. I hope maybe I help others in some way by sharing my story. Take care....,Methadone,35-44,Female
20,20, Zarr| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,This med is a God send. I have PAD (Peripheral Artery-Disease and neuropathy of the legs. I have been in this drug for 3yrs. I could not live life without.,Methadone,45-54,Male
22,22, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,4,4,5,"I know this is a long review but I think it will be helpful for someone to read it in full. This is the best treatment for my addiction for me. I tried doing it on my own| I tried Suboxone| but I still had intense cravings. That is what bothers me the most| the cravings more than the physical withdrawals. Don't get me wrong though| I still hated the physical part. I was abusing Roxicdone and I would take up to 80 mg a day of it. For all the people talking about how they don't like it because it causes withdrawals| that is because methadone is an opioid (also known as a narcotic or an opiate) itself| and all opioids cause withdrawal symptoms after taking them for a long period of time. I started at 20 mg| then quickly went up to 50. After being on it for a few months I thought maybe I could taper and I got down to 20 and was okay for a few weeks| but the cravings came back and were really bad| so my clinic bumped me up to 30 and that's what I take now. I use the orange wafers (also known as disks or diskettes) and I like those better because those last longer. However to get you stabilized| most places will give you liquid only and then transfer you if you want to the wafers because the liquid does start working faster| but as I said the downside of the liquid is it doesn't last as long. Methadone isn't perfect| but it's been a godsend for me. I hate it that I got addicted so young (I am 19) and I don't plan on being on methadone forever| but because of it I have been clean of drugs besides prescribed medications for 4 months now. I have been on methadone longer but I did have a bit of a lapse where I took hydrocodone that wasn't prescribed| but since going back up on my dose from 20 to 30| I have been clean. If you are not as serious of an addict but still can't do it on your own| I think you should try Suboxone first. Methadone in my popnion should only be used if you are really severe (extremely high doses or ""shooting up"")| or if Suboxone has failed.",Methadone,19-24,Male
24,24, greg| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,4,3,I became addicted to Lortab from pain from having joint bleeds.I have hemophilia.Have been on 120mgs for 13 yrs very expensive and long drive wish could get somewhere else.made me gain 85 lbs.but really don't know what I'd do without it but would be great to get off of it it's such a worry.,Methadone,35-44,Male
25,25, will44| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,I was at first like many hating to be attached to a crutch.But if I don't take methadone i relapse because I am an addict 100% it's what Ive done since I was 15 is use drugs and I am 40 now.This drug has saved my life.I function normal as a regular member of the world.You don't have to worry about me stealing from you or breaking into your house or hurting someone to get my needed fix cause I am dope-sick.I work|have a happy marriage|and if I didn't tell you there is no way you would know my history.Ive been on it 10 years and i take 170mg a day at once and no it doesn't get me high!BREAK THE STIGMA METHADONE SAVES LIVES!!!!!!!!!!!,Methadone,35-44,Male
26,26, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,1,1,Unless you are terminal| I advise you against taking this medication!!!  You are surrendering control of you physical and mental health to your prescriber. You will most likely need anticipate your refill date by 3-5 days (God Forbid you forget!)| pick up hard copies of scripts| run them to the pharmacy| wait for them to be filled...etc.  Also be prepared to continually justify your need for the medication as this is contend with repeated efforts to sell you on expensive epidural injections. Remember| that most if not all healthcare organizations and many physcians are PROFIT DRIVEN. AND| whenever you or your prescriber decides you should stop| be prepared to go through HORRIBLE WITHDRAWALS!|This happens even if you taper down gradually. This is because of the drugs very long half life. My experience has been that pain clinic prescribers either do not know how bad This is or do not care. The research on this is specific opioid is unavailable| only for opiates in general. What is out there is for methadone maintenance for heroin addiction treatment only| but not for chronic pain. Methadone is particularly insidious in that you don't feel the high| but it is a VERY strong drug! And| don't count on the support of your prescriber.  Sure they got you dependent on this opiate and profited from the many appointments| but most doctors and pain clinics will not help you through the withdrawal/detox phase. You will be referred to an inpatient rehab clinic that will charge $1400 - $2|000 per day and you will need to stay for at least 5-days!|PLEASE do you the research if you don't believe me. These medical professionals should be ashamed! ITS ABOUT PROFIT!,Methadone,55-64,Male
27,27, f150stx| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,4,4,I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and was originally put on OxyContin due to other Fibromyalgia meds not effectively helping control the chronic pain.  The Original OxyContin| prior to them changing it's formulation| worked great| but after the formula was changed its effectiveness went to crap and felt like 1/4 of what it used to be so I was back to square one.||I see a pain management doctor and he recommended Methadone due to its half life| ability to control pain| and cost effectiveness.  I did my research and was worried about the horror stories I read online.  However| I went with my doctor's recommendation because I trust his experience.  ||In the end| I'm glad I made the switch to Methadone.  The monthly cost is SIGNIFICANTLY less ($10-$15 per month versus $250-$300) and I was able to experience its full effectiveness 3-4 days after starting the medication.  I experience less pain and use less breakthrough medication than what I experienced when on OxyContin..  I have been able to remain on the same dosage for over 1 1/2 - 2 years and hope to stay at the same dosage for as long as possible.||Fibromyalgia patients often get dismissed due to the inability to clearly define the root cause of the pain.  As a result| they are forced to live in pain which significantly reduces their quality of life. Everyone's body| symptoms| and effectiveness of some medications are unique.  I'm lucky and thank God every day I have a knowledgeable| empathic| and caring pain management doctor who believes / believes in his patients.  ||To everyone experiencing chronic pain .. I pray / send positive thoughts your way in hopes you find the relief you deserve to not only improve your quality of life but also to enable you to live your life to the fullest instead of just trudging through and merely surviving day by day.||Good luck and Godspeed!,Methadone,25-34,Male
28,28, Cali| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,5,PEOPLE THINK THIS DRUG IS ONLY FOR ADDICTION. ITS VERY RELEVENT FOR SEVERE PAIN.  i survived a near unliveable injury and also had late stage Lyme and was in so much pain every day I wanted to die. I saw a spinal specialist and he prescribed Nucenta 50mg x 4 a day and oxycodone 15mg for breakthrough pain= 60 a month. The Nucenta was no longer covered under my insurance.  So they increased the oxycodone to 90 mg a day. I still was in a lot of pain and that fact scared me.  Then I saw a pain specialist in LA. He tried the methadone. USE CAUTION WHEN STARTING NEW MEDS- of course. But I started 5mg methadone x 2 a day in addition to OxyCodone and I was able to cut way down on my oxycodone and 9 months later even have days I skip it with increase of 10mg x 2 daily of methadone. I learned that with joint| tissue and muscoskeletal pain that a combination regimen is amazingly beneficial. Get a pain specialist. A good one. Don't stop until you have relief. Life is worth living without being incapacitated by pain. I try to eat right and walk the dogs daily. Doing great!,Methadone,45-54,Female
29,29, RedSonia| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,"I have had cronic pain since i was 25 years old| I am 50. I did not start taking narcotic pain meds till i was 38. I have taken every medication known to help with cronic pain and methadone is by far the best one for me. I can live a normal healthy active lifestyle that would absolutely not be possible without it. I take 60 mgs a day | 20mgs every 6 hours. I have had to be on higher doses every once in a while (highest dose was 150mgs daily) but once the crisses passed it was fairly easy to reduce dosage. I dont feel high| dosn't make me tired after i got beyond the first couple of weeks when i first started to take for pain 6 years ago.Yes i am physically addicted to it| there is no way around that but im technically physically addicted to my heart medication as well as thyroid meds and diebetic meds also. My body physically requires all of these meds to help funtion to the best of my ability. Am i gonna stress about that fact? Absolutely NOT!! As long as i am following my Drs orders and not abuseing any of my meds the rest is the way it is. Does not make me a drug seeker or a ""druggie""| what it does make me is doing my best to cope with pain and still be a productive part of society. I wish people wouldn't lable those of us who take methadone ""addicts"" there is a HUGE difference between being physically addicted and being a ""drug addict"". I hope this helps you feel better if you were someone who was worried about being labled. Like i said| technically we are all physically addicted to whatever meds we may be taking for multiple afflictions.",Methadone,45-54,Female
30,30, Tired of PAIN| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,5,5,This medication is by far the best for chronic pain.  It's not as easy to get it prescribed as it was 5 years ago.  I finally got my new pain doctor to prescribe it for me.  I was on Methadone 6 or 7 years ago| but withdrew from all pain medications.  My spine has deteriorated tremendously over the last 2 years.  So I reluctantly returned to narcotics| but Methadone helps my pain like no other.,Methadone,45-54,Male
31,31, NorthwesternAlumni| 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,4,5,4,I have bone cancer as well as breast cancer.  The pain is indescribable. Since the only types of pain medicine I had ever had in my life was Tylenol and advil my doctors started me out on Norco.  That didn't do anything and so they kept upping the ante so to speak until I was on a lot of dilaudid. I was feeling like I was loosing myself and that's when my doctor suggested Methadone.  Now I know that this is ignorant and I admit I was ignorant because I thought Methadone was for drug users.  I know that it helps with that problem too| so I am not trying to come off degradingly.  After I spoke with the doctor| I spoke with my family and looked it up online.  I decided that I would trust my doctor and try it.  And I feel great considering. It doesn't make me high or loopy. It makes me still feel like me.  It takes away 90% of the pain which for someone with any severe pain would say is INCREDIBLE.  I do also take dilaudid if I have to but those days are few. I love not having to hide in bed because I am loopy.  What little life I have in between treatments is my life again as it should be and I even have more confidence with treating both cancers and its because I am able to control most of the pain.,Methadone,25-34,Female

34,34, Working Man| 45-54 Male  (Patient) ,5,5,5,Although I'm new with it| I think I can accurately describe exactly how it works/feels to me. (35 mg. liquid dose): it's a famtastic anxiolytic. Does not feel like a benzodiazepine| thankfully| but Methadone does give a satisfying state of total relaxation. Barely want to move| but I say that in a nice away. I was surprised by the deeply-satisfying relaxation| because Heroin junkies say Methadone isn't much. (Then again junkies are chronic whiners). I also like the fact that Methadone's effects last for a long time. Wake up the next day still pleasantly relaxed. Pain relief I'd rate only as moderate though| I could see it being ok for mild pain| but not for severe pain. But in summary Methadone is an excellent anxiolytic.,Methadone,45-54,Male

36,36, Marshanipper1| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,4,4,1,I have been on Methadone for 10 years at .5 mg x 2 times a day.  My pain doc said it was a baby dose.  I decided four months ago to withdraw. I started slowly and continued until I was down to just a small piece of the pill.  I was hospitalized one month ago and haven't had the drug since. OMG| I feel like I am having an out of body experience.  My feet| hands| lips are numb.  I can't sleep| eat or function.  I am a complete mess and didn't understand why until I read your comments.  Now that I know I will contact me pain doc and ask for another Rx to continue withdrawing. What a shame.  I never abused this drug.  Was afraid of it from the very beginning but nothing else was working.  Now you have to go to the doctor| secure the Rx| must have a diagnosis code and then| and only then will the pharmacist fill it.  She/he has the right to say NO. Will look at your controlled substance list and will determine if you need med.  The FDA makes the pharmacist file a stack of paperwork to account for your Rx.  Beware| it will be much harder to get and hard-core addicts will be buying it on the street corner. I am praying hard for relief and will continue with .25 mg a day and see what happens.  Think twice before taking this drug.  May you all be well and advised.,Methadone,55-64,Female
37,37, Debrah| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,I was on oxycontin and hydrocodone for 5 years which really screwed up my mental outlook. Was switched to this med; I take 20mg four times a day and it has allowed me to have a normal life. There is no mental manipulation as before and I can be myself and live with my pain. If it weren't for this medication I think I would be a very messed up patient. Am going on my 10th year and it has been working perfectly.

39,39, HappyJoyousFreeB| 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,4,5,I am 23 y/o & have battled Opioid Dependance for 7 years now. I have tried Suboxone maintenance programs| detox programs with Suboxone| detox programs with Subutex| 12 step programs| counseling| going the religious route| & just going flat out 'cold turkey'. Through all of this I had a sincere desire to sober up & change my life for the better yet I couldn't seem to stick to it for one reason or another| no matter what I did. Then I was introduced to the Methadone Clinic from a family member (Opioid Dependance/Addiction runs heavily throughout my family) and so I figured I would give it a go. I had tried everything else & realistically had nothing left to lose. I have been going for a little over two months now & have been clean and sober ever since. I'm sure a lot of people out there carry a negative stigma when it comes to Methadone Clinics & the people who go there every morning... I know I did! But little did I know it would soon become literally the only thing out there that could & would keep a needle out of my arm. I just want to throw out there that this is strictly my experience; this is what worked for me... I pray that no one else out there will struggle for as long as I did| or allow it to get to the extent that I did. But like I said| I haven't been going for long & I am already weaning down off of my original 85 mg dose. I work a 12 step program as well & my sponsor knows about everything regarding the Methadone. I used to hold a lot of guilt for taking the medication while working a 12 step program but today I know that my heart is in the right place & that I want to be 100% mind altering substance free; hence the reason I am already coming down.I just have to remember that I am not a doctor & that this will take time because I do tend to beat myself up & get ahead of myself. Overall this whole experience has benefited me immensely & I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is still suffering & knows they're ready to start living a better life.,Methadone,19-24,Female

I failed several attempts at getting clean. This time when I went to the hospital for detox I was started on methadone and the doctor talked to me about long term use of methadone| the pros and cons| so on and so fourth. Knowing how bad my addiction to opiates had gotten| I was desperate for a solution to help me get clean and STAY clean.||I was hurt in the military so even after my surgery I still had chronic pain however I was not able to control my use of the pain pills. So I needed something to help me not abuse opiates yet help with my continued daily pain as well. One of the times I tried to quit I was put on Suboxone| which made me extremely sick| found out I was allergic to it after several different trials of forms and mgs. ||This time around I started Methadone. All I can say is| METHADONE HAS CHANGED AND SAVED MY LIFE. I am able to live a ""normal"" life!!!!!!!! I am able to get up and do everyday tasks with ease| I am able to be an amazing mother to my 3 year old daughter| I am able to set goals and successfully take the steps to achieve them. I will say the task of going to the clinic everyday to get it has been a pain in the butt| although it beats chasing pain pills 24/7 365. ||Needless to say| I am VERY happy and satisfied. My main side effects are constipation| sugar cravings| extreme drowsiness and profuse sweating. There is a supplement (non prescription) that is available directly from the manufacturer to address these particular side effects. I cannot recall the name however I am trying to look it up as we speak. My clinic informed me of this supplement and has heard nothing but good things about it so as soon as I find it again I am going to order it and try it.|Methadone has a bad rep so people argue with me all the time about it| however if they haven't been in my shoes their opinion doesn't matter to me.|| Methadone saved my life.",Methadone,25-34,Female

I ended up on this 20 years later for chronic pain| Fibromyalgia and Hep C.  I know it is highly addictive but at this point in my life its quality over quantity and I can at least function like a normal person again.  Before this I was laid up for 2 years on my sofa depressed and gaining weight.  I lost 30 pounds within 3 months of taking this just from getting up and around again.  It does not effect my appetite but it does constipate me.  It doesnt make me sick to my stomache if I take it with out food like most pain killers.  I also take Norco (Hydrocodone) for break through pain but am getting switched over to oxycodone because of the amount of aspirin in it.  These 2 together work great and I am hoping the oxycodone will be even better.  Be very careful with this drug.  It is highly addictive and very hard to kick.

So I went to a pain doctor and he scripted methadone.  I took it for one week.  30 minutes after taking the first pill my pain was completely gone.  Little by little the first week parts of my body stop working well.  I could not hear the birds in the mourning.  I couldn't read the tv guide on the tv anymore.  I couldn't fell parts of my body.  My wife was driving me through a car wash| and it scared the life out of me| I got out of the car right in the middle of the car wash.  I stopped taking it that day| One week after I started.  My pain came back quickly| it took 2 weeks for my ears and eyes to work right again.  I had a heart attack 2 weeks later.  My heart stopped for 6 minutes| the ER notes stated the doctor told the nurse to stop trying to resuscitate me| lucky for me the nurse didn't follow directions. The heart doctor couldn't tell me why I had the heart attack.  May be the methadone may be not.  My surgeon would not give me methadone she said I was way to young at 52.  Now I know what she meant. It takes away the pain| but it also takes away your life| hearing| eye site| feeling etc.  I will never take it again.  If your in your mid 80's and are tired of the pain| then it might be for you.,Methadone,45-54,Male

P.| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,4,5,5,In comparison with other narcotic drugs| I find that methadone is not as easily addictive as others|and I have tried most of them. Methadone has a sort of half life the following day which allows dosing to be staggered|(taken every other time)| or missed| if so desired. One can raise or lessen the dose| and gain back the effects/potentcy of the drug. Over the past 15 years I have been on and off of it and I have found it to be the most harmless.

I however went to a detox and quit taking it and took nothing I was detoxed from it in 10 days however i did not replace the methadone with anything. These ""Dr.'s"" who prescribe this medication never tell you the bad side effects of taking it. I weighed 125 lbs prior to starting the methadone before I went to treatment to get off of it I was 195lbs alot of it was water weight. I lost 28lbs the first 18 days. When you get off of this medication you feel like you have been in a coma for the entire time you have taken it. You have to relearn to function as a normal person in the world. A 30 day detox program is not the answer to detox methadone or anyone taking PRESCRIPTION drugs the CORRECT way .....exactly what your bottle says no more!!! I am only sharing from experience this is one of the worst pain medications anyone can be on.....unless you are terminally ill. The Post-Acute Withdraw from this medication can last from 3 months to a year. If you research and look at the brain of a person on methsdone ans then not taking the methadone it takes a YEAR for the brain to completely recover. Just please do your research if this is something you want to be taken off of you need to do it in a hospital or facility that knows how to taper methadone. I am off of the methadone and all pain medications and I have never had less pain.....the methadone increased my pain by 1000x.

213,213, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,2,1,I started the Methadone maintenance plan 8yrs ago. Yes it saved me from the street life I was 19 when I got on the program. I tried detox and treatment more then 10 times but I always went back to the drugs. Methadone helped me to skip the detox and not crave the drugs. Heroin and Crack. I still had to get support for leaving the life of an addict behind but that was easy. Only because I wanted to leave it. Some people are addicted to the lifestyle of a junkie| like my 30 yr old sister who now has HIV and HEP C plus |many serious infections and abscesses. What I was not told when I started the methadone program is how hard it is to get off the meth. I've been trying for years . The withdraw is worse then heroin withdraw. More pain and suffering. I recommend to do the heroin/ crack withdraw if you can. Trust me Methadone is a ball and chain to your ankle. If I could go back knowing what I know now about the program I would put up with detox and support from NA/AA. I still crave heroin and coke/crack. Especially when I am having a real hard time but I know if I go back I lose everything I have gained and done since getting clean. I was almost of the methadone until I had a sever car accident braking my neck and back. Morphine doesn't help the pain when Ur on Methadone so I had to increase my dose more than double. Just to manage the pain. Good luck to anyone who needs support best is to stay off the methadone and just get clean. It possible after a week or 2 of vomiting and aches and pains.

I have fibromyalgia associated with hep c| along with chronic back pain. Methadone has helped me to be able to do everyday routines without feeling high. I have managed to lower my dose from 100mg daily to 30mg daily. It still does the trick. People take way to much of this drug which is very dangerous. You will not get high once your are on it for at least 6 months. Clinics want to get you on as high a dose as you will allow because they know you have to have this medication. To them is all about money. Don't let this happen to you. Withdrawl from methadone is the worst of all pain meds. It can last up to 3 months to ever feel normal again. You will not sleep for 3 weeks even after all other symptoms are gone| but remember a lot of it is psychological. It does what it is supposed to do unless abused. If you can't stay awake you are taking more than you need as well if you can't sleep at night when you first begin you are also taking to much. You must build a tolerance that works for you. For me 30mg is the perfect dose to maintain| not to be taken all at once but divided in 3 doses. Once you get on it don't plan to get off. It ususlly is a lifetime medication just like insulin or high blood pressure meds. Most doctors do not know enough about this drug & therefore will not prescribe it. Like any other pain med it is addictive but can be most beneficial if used properly. It is not a drug you want to run out of...that's for sure.,Methadone,55-64,Female

The big difference is that you are actually doing something really GOOD for yourself for a change. If you dont participate in your own recovery no one is going to do it for you. If you are REALLY SERIOUS about not using|you have to start somewhere. For me Methadone was the way to go. Not everyone has to STAY on this medicine forever|it is a personal choice|but it can  be used as a starting point to becoming opioid free. With the help of your clinic staff| meetings such as N.A. or A.A. and family support it is a very achievable goal.Because of Methadone I have been free from heroin addiction for many years. I began earning ""takehomes"" early on in my recovery and today I only visit my clinic 2 times a month. As a result of being on Methadone|I live a more fulfilling life all the way around. Family|grandkids|health wise|everything. I also volunteer at my clinic as an advocate for patient rights to try and give back to those who helped me.What better way to give back then to help people whose shoes I have actually walked in?? Methadone isn't for everyone|but it does help thousands of people every day to try to put a stop to the craziness of all opiate addictions. There is ALOT of misinformation out there regarding Methadone and I am here to tell you IT CAN AND DOES WORK BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE REALLY READY TO STOP YOUR ADDICTION. If you havent had enough| havent ""hit your bottom"" as they say you will probably fail at every attempt you make to stay clean. But whenever you ARE ready|there are alot of different ways available to you to get clean. Pick the one you think will work for you and put as much into it as you did trying to get loaded.

When I was 18| I was involved in a car accident due to a drunk driver. After the accident| I wasn't able to do anything that normal| pain free| 18 year olds could do. I couldn't even sit through an entire movie with my friends at the theater because my back pain would become so unbearable before the movie even made it half way. I was already taking Oxycontin 40mg ER| as well as the Oxycodone 15mg for the break through pain| that would come on so strong to the point where it would almost take my breath away. My pain management doctor and I discussed and agreed it was time to change my medication. Due to the natural increase in tolerance the human body eventually reaches due to long term use of one medication. That was when the doctor changed me to Methadone 10 mg. We still continued the break through pain medication. After just two days on the new medication| I had my pain rate at a 4 on the pain scale| my pain hadn't been that low on the scale since I was 13 yrs old.

I was unaware this was going to be a problem. I found out way to late. I have lost and are still losing all my once beautiful perfect teeth. It happened within 8 years of starting methadose. It's a lot easier on the liver than some of the other pain meds. As with all medicine| you have to take the bad with the good and decide whats best for you. If your Dr. is good then you should be able to find the right dose for you. It may take some time to adjust to this medicine. Just be sure you don't start out on to high a dose. After I found what dose works best for me| I have never had to raise my dose in 8yrs. It is not like other meds that you get immune to and it stops working so you have to raise your dose. I get the same relief today with the same dose as I had for 8 years. And that is not something you hear said of any other pain medicine on the market that I know of. I hope this helps somebody.

As long as I have muscle relaxers to help with muscle spasm. A lot of people out there think it is a bad drug because you only hear about people who use it to come off of heroine. Used properly it is a Great way to manage pain with way less side effects than other narcotics. I only had about 3 or 4 days of the extreme sleepiness. Taken as it is perscribed| it is great. I feel like me. Not the nightmare I was before. But I think that if a person has issues with dependence they would abuse it| like they will any drug. Unfortunatly a lot people end up being addicted to other pain meds because they are put on the standard narcotics for too long. Then it is all down hill from |there.

306,307, Dr.Gonzo| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,Methadone is a very effective medication for anyone that is severly addicted to opiates/heroin| albeit a very dangerous medication if not used properly| or abused with other drugs| especially any kind of benzodiazepines(i.e. xanax/colonopin). If you're 100% serious| and committed to getting| and staying completly clean| and abstinent from drugs| then this medication will be 100% effective in getting you clean. The only side effects that I personally have had problems with| are constipation| and moderate| to sometime severe sweating. Both of which are absolutley nothing| compared to being addicted to opiates/heroin| and living the lifestyle of an addict. I would highly recommend this medication to anyone that suffers from opiate addiction| or to family/friends that are searching for the most effective treatment for a loved one that suffers from addiction.,Methadone,25-34,Male

365,366, vegasrag| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,1,r pain management| methadone is extremely effective for the control of pain. And it has positive attributes that other opiod type medications lack. Such as not feeling sedated or complete euphoria all of the time and it is excellent at relieving severe pain. I personally was taking methadone for over 15 years for pain management. The longer I took the drug the more side affects I started to experience.AT THIS POINT i OFFER A WORD OF WARNING!!! Once you have become dependent on methadone it's next to impossible to get off of it. Because of the extremely long half life (up to 200 hours according to a recent study) discontinuing use of the drug can put your body in extreme danger.IF YOU MAKE THE DECISION TO USE METHADONE FOR BASELINE PAIN MANAGEMENT PLAN ON TAKING IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. When I stopped using methadone the severe withdrawal affects lasted for 6 weeks and I wasn't physically or mentally stable for at least 6 months.. I made the decision to stop taking pain medication without looking into the consequnces. Within 48 hours I had severe diareha|vomitting|anerexia|dehydration|depression and borderline suicidal tendencies. And I'm someone that would never take my own life! I collapsed and my family called 911. From this point I didn't remember the next 14 days. When the paramedics saw me they thought I had taken an overdose of methadone and injected me with a narcotic antagonist called Narcon. I immediately went into seizure. Buy the time I got to the hospital I had 2 grand mal seizures and died. Thay were able to revive me but once I was in the emergency room it occured one more time and I had to be revived again. For the next 10 days I was on life support in ICU. Once released from the hospital it took a month before I could control my bowel movements|able to feed myself|see across the room or walk without assistanse. I hope that at least one person reads this and takes it to heart. Most people end up on it for the rest of thier life.-------Rick G.,Methadone,45-54,Male
366,367, kvgkegsmeg| 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,4,5,This drug has really turned my life around! Yes| it does have MANY side effects and if you are like me| the clinic is a pain to deal with. But it does get better. I have been on methadone since Feb '06 after my father-in-law overdosed on oxycontin. I am in the healthcare field and have researched extensively all the side effects and TRUE data from real trials. Most people gain weight| but that is only due to an increase in cravings for sweets| not to mention you probably weren't eating hardly anything when you were using. Constipation is a very real and sometimes bothersome side effect but I find that most people would rather be constipated than using or withdrawling. Now withdrawls are horrible. BUT if you will use the medicine like you are supposed to and slowly taper down| which may take quite a long time| you can be successful. Overdoses are NOT as common as the media likes to make it sound. 99 times out of 100 the overdose is due to interactions with other drugs| usually xanax. Also| contrary to popular belief| methadone does not get you high and most of those that need a higher dose are NOT doing it just to abuse the treatment. They normally have a high tolerance.

Because I have low energy on methadone I was told I would need to take anti-depressants to boost mood and energy.  This drug starts benign and gets worse and worse.

I thought it was a miracle drug at first but soon changed my mind when I tried to come off of it! It is extremely hard to come off of and you have to go through the same withdrawls as other opiates just not as bad and they are monitored by the *methadone clinic*. Yes it helped at first and continues to help but some of the side affects are extremely aggravating such as constipation| weight gain| very serious interactions with other drugs such as xanax!| lack of sleep| and the price of the medication (13.00) a day and the clinic is 30 minutes from my house that at first i had to travel everyday and now i get take homes and have to go to the clinic 4 times a week but the money is the number issue as the clinic does not accept insurance! The clinic is aggravating as they only accept cash in bill form no loose change and they do not give change they put it on the books for the next day!

Most think it is a drug used for drug additics| to help their drug withdrawel symtomps from illegal drugs easier to cope with; which it is used for in methadone clinics for meth addicits and of course in all kinds of drug treatment programs.  But it is also an excellent pain relivier for people who are opiate tollerent and have tried most of the other pain relievers (both prescribed and over the counter).  I have cancer| Reflex System Dystrophy a.k.a. CRPS| and Fibromyalgia.  I have used prescription pain killers for the past 17 years.....with a ""cure"" break of about 2-3 years with zero to minimal pain medications.  My physicians started me on everthing you can imagine over the counter| and then went the start of what has fealt like an endless line of prescribtion drugs.  To make a longer story a bit shorter I still have all the above list disease and last year found Fentanyl (100mcg) Pain Patches to be a great relief from pain| with Percocet 10/325 used for breakthrough pain only.  But as of 2010| the patches fell off my preferred drug list and were only covered at a certain percentage; which might not have been so bad| but the cost of each 100mcg patch was around $50 each.  I was prescribed one every other day with a monthly retail price of around $600-$700 (depending on pharmacy and if they were willing to help me and give me the patches at what the insurance companies get them for).  Therefore| I am now on a very great medication that is around $70.00 a month for 540 tablets a month called Methadone.  I am taking 6 10mg tablets three times a day| which is a MAJOR MAJOR dose.

587,588, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,3,4,I began taking methadone 16 months ago due to severe long-term addiction to oxycontin. During active addiction I was diagnosed with MS and now have chronic headaches due to herniations and bulging of disks in my neck on top of nerve endings that feel like they are on FIRE! Methadone has been a blessing in helping me with my addiction and relieving ALOT of the pain. However| my heartbeat has slowed and there is evidence of arrythmia. I am finally settled on a dose and have just stopped taking benzos (another no no for those on methadone). My question to the readers of this post is| based on my pain relief and getting through the addiction issues. What would you think of my continuing treatment given the heart problem?  Since being weaned off of the benzos and other depression meds| my heartbeat averages @ 60 bpm at age 42 with some signs of arryhthmia. My heart rate fell to an average of 42 bpm 5 months ago with all of the other  meds on top of methadone. Given all of this| has anyone else had the same problems and what should I do?  I'd like to continue use but the heart thing scares me even though it is coming back to normal. I'm tired of addiction and tired of pain.

607,608, mandyjuelz| 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have been taking methadone for 3 yrs almost and it has been a lifesaver!  I was shooting $400.00 a day worth of oxycontin| fentanyl| and heroin in my arm and I had lost everything I had worked for by the age of 21.  I began the program at the methadone clinic just because I could no longer afford my habit.  I still continued to use when I first started the program.  But| then after a while| I realized that methadone was working fine and that I didn't have to use anymore.  Because of methadone| I have rekindled relationships with my friends and family (who now trust me again)| I've got a wonderful job and my own house and car.  I have to start over from scratch at 22 yrs. old| but I'm so glad I did.  If you take this drug the way it is prescribed and actually make an attempt to follow the program| then it will work and it will change your life. I would be dead if it weren't for this miracle drug.  Yes| withdrawal from methadone is awful and worse than heroin withdrawal| but if you follow the program correctly and SLOWLY taper down the way you are supposed to then you won't experience any of this horrible withdrawal.  You hear people talk about how horrible this drug is because of the severe withdrawal| well if they would have follwed the program right| instead of continuing to still get high and get kicked off the program| then they wouldn't experience this bad withdrawal.  People who continue to get high while on the program are the people that give methadone rehabilitation a bad stigma.  Also| you hear people talk about how they'd like to have methadone taken off the market b/c their loved ones od'ed| etc.  Well| 9 times out of 10| it' because they were probably abusing it| not taking it they way it was prescribed| or because they mixed it with another narcotic.  I wish people would realize how many lives this drug has SAVED....including mine. With it| you get less addicts| less people stealing| less transmitted disease from IV use| etc.  It's a miracle drug!,Methadone,19-24,Female

I take 40 mg of methadone per day| 2 daily| and 2 before bed. Other than severe episodes of drowsiness| which go away after a 30 min nap| I find that this medication works very well for me.  Before taking methadone| I was taking 10 mg percocets every 6 hours for pain management.  I found that the percocets kept me up at night| and soon they didn't work aswel as they were at first do to tolerance biuld up.  I also found that when I started taking methadone for pain after I had been taking the percocets| I no longer would have anxious episodes in between my percocet doses| kind of like tiny withdraw episodes because the percocet would only last me 3 hours after a while.  I found myself suffering for 3 hours in between my regular every 6 hour doses.

I started on oxycontin but after 5 years I began to notice that I was forgetting things and I was always so tired.  My family was concerned about my forgetfulness and the constant sleeping as well.  My doctor switched me to Methadone and thank God.  I am clear headed| the pain is not completely gone but I didn't expect it to be.  I learned a long time ago that there is really nothing that will take the pain away 100%| and once I dealt with that and changed my expectations| I found the methadone to be the best drug for me.  I use oxycodone daily for occasional flare ups in my pain level.  My biggest struggle has been finding and keeping a doctor who will prescribe the high dosage of medication I need to be able to function.  I went on disability 10 months ago and thought my pain level would go down due to the change in my activity level. It didn't| so again I had to change my expectations.

After we discussed the benefits v. drawbacks| I decided to give it a shot since none of my prior meds worked to my satisfaction. ||I have found that| in my case| this medication is far superior to others for a number of reasons. It helps me deal with my pain while allowing me to function in a normal manner. My tolerance has not increased in the 3+ years I've been using this med| as compared to all the others. The dose is long acting| plus I don't need to take as much to relieve my pain. I am also able to sleep at night (for once!)| and don't wake up groggy or fuzzy the next day. ||This medication takes a few days to get into your system properly| so don't be impatient and exceed your dose. As it cannot be refilled over the phone at your neighborhood pharmacy| if you run out before your next appt. you may experience some degree of opiate withdrawal. Rather than go 'cold turkey'|  you can probably take a little less for a few days in order to build up a supply to help you thru til your next appt.

I take an extremely low dosage each day and feel like it somewhat balances out my brain chemistry as well as helping with back pain. I decided a couple of months ago to ""give it a rest"" for a while!  What a joke! Keep in mind if you start on this drug you will have to take about a two week trip to Hell and back to get off of it! It's not mentally addictive at all but physically it's at the top of the chart. Side effects for me are swelling feet and craving sugar like you can't imagine...thus weight gain bigtime.

It works longer and will not destroy your teeth or bones if you follow proper oral hygiene & simply take care of yourself. I personally feel that no one  needs more than 60 mgs. daily. It is a blocking dose & will prevent other narcotics from working properly. Benziods do not mix with methadone & will kill you very quickly. If you take this drug for the proper reasons it will work very well for you. If you are abusing it I can assure you; you will not do it for long.

717,718, katodd| 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,4,5,I started taking methadone for an addiction to heroin in August of 2007.  I had been shoting the drug for almost 5 years and had a very bad habit.  I had heard many negative tings about methadone such as it rottes your teeth and destroys your bones.  That it is more addctive than heroin and that it's just trading one addiction for another.  i soon found this was otally wrong.  If used properly and in addition to positive counseling it is a wonderful treatment method.  As long as you are on your blocking dose you will have no withdrawal symptons and should not get any signs of being high.I did experience a slight case of constipation and every once in a while it appears again.  I have had great success with methadone maintence treatment and highly recommend it to anyone who really wants to get clean from addiction.  Find out about it if you are still not sure.  Do some research and talk to people who are on it.  I'm sure you will find that all the myths you've heard are just that- myths.  Methadone helped saved my life.,Methadone,25-34,Female

719,720, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,1,5,1,My family doctor referred me to a pain clinic for chronic migraines| neck and back pain and the pain-specialists prescribed Methadone for my pain.  The first day on this medication| I felt like a teenager again| each day after the less effective it was for my pain and it was down hill from that point.  I am aware that when a patient is put on this drug that one should be monitored daily for 2 weeks for blood pressure declines.  Within the first week of taking this drug| I was in the ER 3 times and was told that if I continued taking this medication| I would DIE.  I contacted my pain doc who ignored my calls and ignored the 7 lbs. of fluid that was in my feet.  Upon waking each morning| I would begin hallucinations and by the end of the week| I went to see my family doc who immediately admitted me into the hospital because my O2 stats had dropped down to 71.  I spent 4 days and nights in the critical care unit and the doctors refused the truth that it was the methadone and not some other condition that put me there and on death's door.  After every test| xrays| sonograms and test for blood clots| my discharge papers read a severe allergic reaction to Methadone.  When I returned to my pain specialists| he was more than willing to change his choice of pain medicine but| still refused to admit that the Methadone nearly took my young life.  If this drug works for you| I am glad but| if you experience waking in the night and cannot breathe and experience swelling| please stop taking the drug.,Methadone,35-44,Female
720,721, 45-54 Female  (Patient) ,5,5,2,I have used Methadone for 36 years. As a result of Methadone treatment I do not use Heroin anymore| nor did I experience any withdrawal symptoms or craving when I stopped using Heroin. Methadone is 100% effective. |In addition| as a result of being on a Methadone Maintenance Program I have avoided the dangers and risks often associated with use of Heroin. My life stabilized. I went to college| became a RN| got married| raised children. I do not use other drugs nor drink.|While Methadone is a good alternative|  a solution to Heroin's addiction| I have to say I honestly believe this is due to Heroin being an illegal drug and Methadone being a legal one. |Use of Methadone not just to detox but as long term maintenance potentially precludes both the physical danger/risk and the social; such as HIV| AIDS| and overdose| and via needles| also abscess| infection| sepsis| amputation of limbs. Than there's also obvious social risks avoided such as arrest and incarceration| involvement with crime and unsavory people in general| loss of: employment| a house/housing| a love life and there is an impact on relationships in general. |However... Methadone is far far harder to get off. I could and did stop Heroin. Going cold turkey was not a big deal. I went cold turkey maybe 40 ?? times. I would stay clean. The problem was I always eventually went back. |I am terrified of Methadone withdrawal. I am on 110 mg. and I believe there is a good chance I would have seizures or die if inadvertently I was somehow unable to get my dose. Methadone withdrawal is far more serious| more intense. While Methadone's effects last longer so do all aspects of withdrawal. Kick Heroin in 3-5 days. With Methadone it may be a year before you really feel OK.|Problems I have experienced with regard to Methadone are not a result of the chemical itself but are a result of the clinics that dispense| ignorance| the politics of addiction| and government policy.,Methadone,45-54,Female

I have a degenerating spine and have had 2 surgeries.  It started with my cervical spine (now fused) and now my lumbar spine has another disc that is herniated.  It causes me severe pain all day and night.  Without pain medication I  have to stay in bed all the time. I have taken Methadone for the past 4 years and it has managed the pain well. I am able to cook| clean and do some gardening while taking this medication. It is inexpensive and easy to take.  After a move to the south last year| I found that Drs here are very reluctant to prescribe this medication. Even with my 20 years of medical records in hand| no one would fill my medication. I had to go to a ""pain clinic"" which was a nightmare.  They count your pills as if you were an addict and make you give urine tests every month. It was dirty and very unorganized. If you can't give a urine sample on the spot....they ""drop"" you.  Unbelievable.  So now I find myself on Oxycodone which does not work well| doesn't last as long and costs almost $200.00 for a 1 month supply. A far cry from the $40.00 for Methadone.

Methadone has been a life saver!!! I cannot stress enough how well it has helped me with my chronic pain| and I only use morphine for 'breaktrough pain.' This drug has given me my life back. NOT TO EXAGGERATE BUT IT HAS GIVEN ME MYSELF BACK. I do not feel drugged. I feel clear-headed and as much as a 'normal' person can feel. The goal for me is to live a full and active life without having to resort to my breakthrough medication. I have suggested this to my Mother who suffers evey day from severe| completely debilitating chronic pain| but her doctor refuses to give her methadone but oxycodone instead. (That drug made me CRAZY)! Two friends have chronic debilitating pain| but their doctors refuse to help them off their opiates and on to methadone.  I feel like shouting from the rooftops that it is truly a wonder drug for chronic pain and will give yourself back to you. I truly believe that doctors now need to be educated that methadone is a wonder drug compared to having a patient on opiates for years. DOCTORS ARE HOLDING PEOPLE BACK FROM FEELING PAIN RELIEF!!!!! and ignore all the stigma associated with this drug! Thank you for allowing me to get on 'my soapbox' and in this way| I am shouting from the rooftops!  Thank you.  Jacklon Stanley| Greenfield| IA,Methadone,55-64,Female

I have never taken any hard drugs in my life but I believe that this is as bad as being addicted to heroine when you miss a dose you'll feel as if somethings wrong thats when I realize I haven't taken my pill when I was supposed to.

(My tolerance level was increasing with the Oxycodone) I had a ""choice"" between Methadone and Morphine. Morphine scares me| so I gave Methadone a try. So far| after 6 months| it has worked fairly well. I haven't had any adverse affects. The best part of all is that it doesn't cost ""an arm and a leg"" as Oxycodone does. I have no insurance at all| so any money I can save out of pocket helps. As long as I can live my life to the fullest without having this constant pain stopping me in my tracks| it is well worth it to try whatever your pain management doctor suggests for your specific problem. Everyone is different and will react differently to various pain medications. So far| Methadone seems to be working well for me and since I don't have a problem with abuse| my doctor and I have worked together in keeping the dosage on the various pain meds relatively low over the years.  The only drawback to any pain meds for me is the constant question| ""When can I ever quit these things and lead a normal ""un-drugged"" life?""

My second baby was a healthy 6 pounds and 3 ounces. She stayed in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for about 6 weeks. The doctors put her on very| very low doses of Morphine for Methadone withdrawals. Then they detoxed her off of the morphine slowly. She's now 3 months old and doing great. I know that we are now addicted to methadone but it's better than what we were doing before treatment. We're not always chasing a pill| dealing with bad people in bad places| breaking the law| spending all of our money (and everyone else's for that matter)| lying to the people that care about us| risking overdosing| or any other problems from being unstable on different medications that we weren't prescribed to. We're now on a stable dose that is managed by a doctor and is legal. We take regular drug screens| go to meetings| and meet with our own assigned counselors regularly. Everything is not ""all better now"" and probably never will be because we are addicts. But I can say that we both have had great benefits from this program.

YES| you are better off putting a needle in your arm then putting this poison into your body. herion is the lesser of two evils.

I WAS TOLD NOTHING!!!! If nothing i wrote made you think| think about this| why does it take an average person on the same mg 5-7 days to detox from herion and methadone is 19 to 30. or better yet next time you see your doc ask them what post accute withdraw from methadone means.

I did read on this website about another drug called subutex and was quite interested in it but don't know much about it. So for now I'll stick with what's working even thought I can't stand the taste and it makes my stomach nasusa.  It keeps the pain somewhat at bay| not my headaches though.

I started using pain pills ligitamitly  when I was 17| and became addicted very quickly. My use progressed to heroin| to avoid withdrawl. Then| i got pregnant| and joined a methadone clinic. My son was born| with a slight addiction| but with the use of pheonabarbatol was fine in 8 days. I have been on the program for 3 years now and have recently started a taper| to eventually came off. It has given me my life back. I am now a productive| working| clean and sober wife| mom| and daughter. My only complaints| are that I have gained over 60lbs. and am finding it very difficult to lose the weight. I was perpared to gain some weight| at first| due to my eating habits becoming normal again. It has also messed with my teeth| they are weakened| and chip easily.But| negitive symptoms aside|I could not have gotten this far| if not for my clinic and more importantly| my counsolers| and support group. If I had not changed my habits| like the places I hang out or the people with whom I hang out| I would have probably relapsed after I had the baby. But| with the help of wonderful people like my counsoler at the clinic| I am now studying to get my CCDC (certified chemical dependancy counsoler) So| hopefully by the time I am off the methadone| I can help others going thru the same things i went thru. The only other neg. thing about methadone| is that when you are on a clinic| you are tied to it. But| compared to what I went thru to get my drugs before| it is nothing to go to a clinic for 10-20 mins. a day. You also can't just stop| the withdrawl from methadone is worse than any other opiate| I dont know why| but it is. That is why it is going to take me at least 1 year to come off my dose. But all in all| Methadone saved mine| and my sons' lives| and I am forever grateful for the second chance at life!",Methadone,25-34,Female

1005,1006, MM| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have been on pain medications for years now due to cancer and complications from cancer and chemotherapy/surgery.  I have taken several different types of pain medication including Oxycontin 160mg| MS Contin 100mg| Fentanyl patches 150 mcg| Dilaudid 4mg| and MS IR 15mg.  Eventually I was so tolerant to opiates that nothing worked.  My Oncologist referred me to a Pain Clinic where I was prescribed Methadone 20mg four times per day.  The difference has been phenomenal!  I get much more pain relief with almost no side effects.  Methadone provides pain relief without the euphoria and the roller coaster ride of highs and lows that the other opiates cause.  It amazes me that Methadone still carries such a negative connotation in society| especially in the Medical community.  Physicians continue to be afraid to prescribe Methadone for pain even in cancer patients and other patients with extremely painful conditions.  Methadone is an excellent drug and very inexpensive compared to other opiates which are much less effective.  Hopefully| one day soon| Methadone will no longer be Taboo in our society and suffering patients will be able to obtain Methadone without being treated like drug seeking junkies.,Methadone,35-44,Male

When I was no longer in pain I stopped taking the medication I suffered from withdrawl.  I began drug seeking and continued for several years.  I am now on methadone for treatment and I have never felt better.  I dont get high from the drug and the withdraw is gone.  I am an avid supporter of methadone programs for opiate dependence and suggest anyone who is an opiate addict try this treatment.  For those seeking pain relief| methadone is a long acting drug with a half life.  It does work for pain but your body determines how well it will work.  Talk to your doctor about other pain medications.  If it is for long term pain| withdraw from methadone is alot easier to deal with than say percocet or oxycodone|  I highly advise all narcotic pain med users to find a new type of drugs| narcotics are dangerous and lead to addiction if abused or used for long periods of time.  AI's work just as well for most types of pain| I have used both many times for the same type of pain and the AI's always win out in relief.   Methadone is great for opiate addicts but in my opinion| any narcotic is too much for pain relief as well as too dangerous.,Methadone,25-34,Male

1051,1052, meaningfulc| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have had chronic pain due to multiple jaw joint surgeries that were done in the 80's and the last jaw surgery in 1995.  It took me a long time to finally find pain management drs.  Back in the 1990's there were very few drs. willing even to prescribe codeine for my pain.  They would get so nervous about that!  The methadone has really given me so much pain relief I don't know what I would do if I did not have it now.  I have a wonderful pain management dr. that prescribes other meds along with the methadone.  Prior to the methadone my other dr. was giving me Oxy-Contin in strong doses| which worked great too| but now that I am taking methadone for more than 4 years now| I would not change back to the other strong opiods I had prescribed before.  I am not pain free| but my life is sure much better than before.,Methadone,55-64,Female

Please read all of the literature and inform your family about this medication in case things go bad for you and you require emergency assistance.  This med needs close medical supervison; it is not a pain pill that you can just pop into your mouth and find instant relief from pain.  I have had to return to my old treatment.  Understand that you may not be able to drive while on Methadone| and there is a huge list of meds that cannot be taken with Methadone.  If you have had even one seizure be sure to print this on your forehead so your doctor will read it because Methadone can put you at risk for seizures.  It stays in your body for a long time so any side effects you have will go one for days not hours.  The only good thing I can report is that it is an inexpensive medication and some people do well on it but I had a terrible week of suffering because of it.,Methadone,45-54,Female

I use to suffer daily bouts and now I only have 1 to 2 days out of the month that I suffer. Methadone has been a wonder drug for myself and my husband.,Methadone,35-44,Female

I take up to 15 mgs a day and have for over 31 months chronic lower back-pain and there are days the pain causes me to not be able to walk or stand so having this to help ease the pain is a Blessing. I really hate when I see a new Doctor and they ask if I am  a drug-addict or an alcoholic all because I take methadone for pain| they should think before saying something to insulting a person that lives with chronic pain daily.

I have two other powerful pain meds that bring the pain down to a 4 on a 1-10 pain scale.  No one pain medicine helps me.  So I guess morphine helps. It is very cheap.

I have been taking pain meds for about 10 years now. I make clots|like super in medical journal ones. Started 24 years ago| my body will even make them on coumadin if they dont keep my inr high enough. My body tolerates opiates really well but it also becomes immune to the effects easy. My legs are the sites of my clots| 4dvts in left and 2in right i have also had 2pulmonary embolisms almost died. I am lucky in that my dr is amazing. I was on methadone 120mgs daily but wasn't getting good coverage have tried oxy|percocet didnt do a thing for me. Dr put me on this 90mgs daily and all i can say is WOW im getting coverage like when i first started takeing methadone. Oh and let me tell u bloodclots are more painfull then kidney stones (yes had those too). Only the pain never actually goes away| just dims some. Mine have completly destroyed my circulation in left leg| and nerves are on constant alert sending pain signals to brain 24/7/365. Right leg is less damaged| but still hurts. So far only complaint is upset tummy| but not bad dr gave me prilosec and if im REALLY active not as good relief but you know what| ill take it. I noticed alot of u worry about addiction| but my outlook is| quality of life over quantity and i know physical addiction is gonna happen nothing i can do about that| but i just keep active| keep my loved ones close and involved trusting them to let me know if they see any symptoms of abuseing (i guess im lucky don't seem to have addictive personality).

I don't know what I would do without it. I take the sustained release 60 mg twice a day. If I have break-through pain I take morphine instant release 10 mg.  Thank God my present doctor prescribes them for me. When my previous doctor retired three doctors would not take me as a patient b/c I was on morphine which I had been on for seven years at that time.  It's not perfect but without I suffer a lot more.

It seemed like I was constantly taking the pills and they were working for a shorter duration as time went on.Both my doctor and myself were concerned about the acetametifen. I was initially afraid of it. The thought of morphene kind of scared me. I thought it might make me nod off or drool| or in some way make me stupid. None of that was the case at all.I function very well and felt much better with far fewer pills. I've lost over a hundred pounds and stablized my blood sugar and my blood presure| along with a much improved outlook and attitude. The problem I have now is that my doctor fell ill and can no longer practice. I don't know how to find a new doctor who will not think I am a drug seeker if I tell him morphene has worked very well for me and basically given me a new lease on life. I am 57 years old and a couple of years ago I would have thought the same thing. So right now| it's difficult trying to find a new doctor because won't know me. The situation is made much more difficult by the fact that I'm broke and don't have insurance. Morphene is actuallymuch cheaper than most other  medications.

The 30mg dose| 3 times daily| actually reduced the pain rating by 2 or 3 on the hgih end| and with Lortab for breakthrough| we had finally found a drug that| though not perfect| did better than anything else in the formulary.  After a few years| the effectiveness lowered| and the PCP doubled the dose to 60mg x 3| and 4 years later| again I reported overall pain levels increasing| and at that time| one year ago| she raised the dose to 100mg x 3.  I was hesitant to accept this last doseage increase| as the respiratory system can be depressed with opioid use| and breathing has always been high on my list of things to do.  However| with pain that can be so severe that I would be brought to tears many times a day| and unable to sleep for mone than an hour or two at a time| I did take the increase.  Each time| after a short adjustment period when I felt the ""euphoric"" side effects| that part went away| and the MS-C went back to doing an adequate job of reducing the severity of my pain.  My advice:  Don't ask for increases in doseage.  Stick  with describing the pain you are feeling| and allow your PCP to determine the best way to handle it.  If you have a good doctor who is familiar with your problem(s)| and is sensitive to the same| he/she help  you decide how to best manage your pain.",Morphine,55-64,Male

It works well to keep my pain at a manageable level.  I have developed a tolerance to it so that it does not make me sleepy and the only effects I notice are a reduction in my pain level.  The only problem I have with MSContin is the constipation it causes.  Miralax seems to work the best to relieve the constipation.  Also| it is necessary for me to take 10mg Percocets to help with breakthrough pain several times a day when the pain spikes.  Aside from constipation| my only other criticism of MSContin is that it takes a long time to start working.  If I am late taking my pill and my pain level gets worse| the MSContin takes about 90 minutes before it ""kicks in"".

1438,1441, this is an honest review | 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have had chronic pain since I was 18 years old due to Porphyria (coproporphyria) and have had may visits to the ER because none of my prescribed pain meds. have worked for break-through or severe pain episodes.  My pain doctor has prescribed Vicodin and Norco along with 200 mg Fentynl patches for everyday paid with little or no relief.  So I have been living with pretty severe pain every day.  (I had tried morphine about ten years ago| but at the time I was working full-time and had little children at home - morphine didn't fit my situation at that time.) I recently asked him to change to Morphine last week| and finally he did.  To my great surprise within a few days I was pain free except for break-through pain attacks (for which he has prescribed 1200 mcg Fentanyl Citrate lozenges| aka Actiq).  I am so happy to experience less pain in my day to day living.  It has been such a relief!  To any Porphyria patients| or any chronic pain sufferer| you must take control - don't let your doctors intimidate you - you know your body and your pain better than anyone else.  Make sure you research your pain meds. and make your doctors prescribe the meds. that will help you the most!,Morphine,55-64,Female

A lot of you are asking for advice as far as your nasal spray. They make an oxycodone NSL if that's the delivery method you need. The best thing is to be open and honest w your Dr. And to find yourself a good one. We may require opioid meds but we still deserve the right treatment plan just like anyone else. For people out there not in the know Methadone is very effective as a pain killer and cheaper retail than most meds w a co-pay. It gets expensive when you truly are in chronic pain.|Happy health! -B.

After the effectiveness of other pain meds (vicodin| percocet| etc.) kept needing increasing amounts of the drug to keep the pain at bay| my pain clinic doctors had me evalutated at a hospital and started me on 60 mg tabs used in conjunction with Fentanyl patches.  After using this combination for a year| I had to drop the Fentanyl patches because I had reached the max allowable payout for this med after 10 months into the year.  My doctor's then decided to put me on morphine 100 mg tabs 3 times a day.  At first I had severe constipation| but never did I feel the brain fog others have warned me about.  I find myself able to use less than 3 tabs a day at times| and I am glad not to have to worry about changing patches every third day because I used to forget and would become ill| not remembering that I had to change a patch to prevent myself from going into detox.

I have 24/7 severe pain.  I get so depressed and withdraw from everyone (mentally) It affects my relationships with family and friends.  I am 28 years old and the only thing keeping me from walking is pain. So wheelchair it is when the pain is overwhelming so much that I beg God to take me ""home"" Recently I found a WONDERFUL Dr.  that has really given me hope.  He really cares and sits and discusses every option with me.  I am on 16 different meds but my pain doc has me on Fentynal 100 mcg/hr change every 36 hours and has just added Morphine Sulfate Instant Release 30mg every 3 hours as needed for break though pain which is a Godsend.  I have been on every pain med in the PDR eg. Dilaidid 4mgX4 OxyContin 160x3 Methadone 20mgX4 MScontin 200x3| etc etc....I am happy with this combo.  I just started Cymbalta 30mg| I also take Neurontin 400mgX3| Soma 350x6| Baclofen pump will be implanted in July|  as oral is ineffective Dilaudid will be mixed with baclofen|  I also take Zoloft 150mg.  Imitrex 100mg as needed| I am also going to be getting a spinal cord stimulator inserted soon.  The key to getting good care is finding a good doctor and research your choice do not just make an appointment with the first one you see in the phone book or the one closest to your home.  Drive the distance because your quality of life hangs in the balance.  I know that it took me many years to finally find a doctor that made me feel like I mattered. I also get epidural blocks but with little relief.  Also take advantage of any psychotherapy that your PAIN doctor may offer to find way to cope with the way your pain has affected you and your loved ones.

To replace the liquid morphine that was pumped into my spine| had to go on 100mg MORPHINE SULFATE 3x per day to equal amount of liquid morphine that was in the pump.

1563,1566, joecomeriv| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,3,5,1,I have been on pain meds since 1986 tried them ALL by now. I first tried morphine around 1993 30mgSR gained very little pain relief in 96 I was put on 20mg MScontin 2tabs 3times a day and 3 tabs at night what a God send After nearly given up on life I was finding REAL pain RELIEF!! by 2001 iwas stable and feeling the best I felt in years of what I considered pure agony. Iwas now on 80mg3xday and 30mgIR'sX4 I switched pain clinics and went through the V.A. who switched me back to morphine Ihave been taking 30 mgSR and 15 mg ir Barely enough to get me out of bed i have given it an honest effort for 7 months now... I can not wait to get back to another pain clinic and back on mscontin... Morphine locks up my jaw when I first eat makes my gut hurt when I first ingest the tabs for several minutes I feel tired but still in horrific pain..I have difficulty sleeping all these symptoms faded while on mscontin and I felt the best I know I can And will feel............If you are looking for pain relief and want some quality of life back I urge you to use mscontin or at least give it a try yes it is addicting but so is morphine INFACT withdraw is worst on Morphine or at least  it was for me... HOPE this helps J,Morphine,45-54,Male
1564,1567, Mojo| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,3,5,3,I am going through severe pain with Rheumatoid Arthritis throughout most of body. Have been on lortab| methadone and oxy prior to recent change per doctor to morphine. Have only been on morphine for about 3 weeks now. Not quite sure if itis helping pain or not. Lortab did not last very long at all and was not strong enough to resolve pain issue. The problem I was having with methadone and oxy was that both of these put me to sleep at any time.  For example; at dinner| riding in car| etc.  I do not drive auto| thank goodness.  Does or did anyone else have trouble with falling asleep with either methadone or oxy? Both of these really helped with my pain but I was more or less bedridden as I would wake up in morning| take meds and go back to sleep.  Was actually worthless in life.

Want to be more active  with my kids| youngest being 5| and find myself not being able too! It is just sickening especially since the MVA was not my fault! At 38 I wonder how I am going to make it through another 28 years of working!

I can't even load the dishwasher without being in tears. All I can say is that without this med the pain would be unbearable all the time. I have a great doctor who knows that I am in pain all the time and recognizes the need. I am hopeful to all of you out there still searching that you will give this a chance. My doctor wanted to put me on this med and I refused due to concerns of addiction etc. But keep in mind| the Tylenol in Vicoden and Norco is worse than this medication.

I was seeing my primary care Dr. (bad healthcare organization) and was very undermedicated. A previous Dr. had me taking a total of 40 mg of percocet a day (oxycodone and tylenol). When I started with KP| the Dr. only gave me 20 mg a day| reluctant like many Dr's to give pain meds. Despite walking around on torn ligaments| because of my age at the time (25)| everyone kept telling me ""I was too young to have so many health issues"". I was then placed on a NINE month wait period for surgery. In the meantime I was reffered to pain management. That was the best thing that happened because of the Dr's knowledge and understanding of chronic pain. Started taking 30 mg morphine er 2x a day. After the 1st surgery| the hospital lost ALL of the film| AND surgical reports. My knee was 10x worse after the botched surgery than before. Now| 3 years and 2 more corrective surgeris later the meds have been upped to 500mg of morphine er and 40mg of percocet a day| and a home electrical stim machine.  The moral of my story is GET A GOOD DOCTOR! Anyone experiencing chronic pain should go to a pain specialist immeadiatly. I tolerate the dose well now that it's been almost 4 yrs. The one thing that bothers me every time I have to get my refills is the STIGMA that these meds carry.

It does not have the usual side effects of flu like systems |headaches or dry mouth. It has been my experience that the longer I have taken it | I could increase the time between dosages and very little problem with withdrawal when I stopped taking it . Also to me it did not upset my stomach or caused urination problems. One problem that I encountered when I first started the medication was blurred vision. That to me was the only problem that I had. Over the past five and a half years it is the only medication that can be taken for chronic to severe pain. I was involved in an auto accident in which I suffered major neck and back injuries and this is the only medication my pain management specialist found that would work safely. The reason for this is due to the fact that I have a heart problem that is critical and I can not be put under for corrective surgeries . They actually stated the medication helps the heart by increasing to some degree the veins and arteries that deliver the blood to and from the heart . They do however monitor my heart| kidneys and liver to make sure there is no onset damage.,OxyCodone,65-74,Male

Pain was unbearable with out it. Initially given as 2 Percocet (5/325 each)| then just Oxy alone. Works best for pain relief when combined with acetaminophen (ie Percocet). You can make the combo at home as long as you closly monitor the Acetaminophen intake. Tell/ask your doctor you are doing this. Oxy does give me sweats and chills and does make me tired. It also messes up short term memory. They are a small price to pay for the extreme pain I would be in otherwise. Always monitor this medicine w/a doctor and begin weening yourself off it as soon as you can tolerate the pain. After 1 week from surgery I am down to 2.5mg Oxy and 250mg Acetaminophen every 4-5 hours. This is my first time taking this medicine and it has worked better than anything I've taken in the past.,OxyCodone,45-54,Male

1787,1793, Laura K| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,3,5,1,I was given Oxycodone for arthritic pain| and I had been taking Vicodin| but my doctor did not want me to take it any longer due to too much Acetaminophen. I also have Asthma| but it is not usually a problem| and is well controlled with my inhalers. I took the Oxycodone for about 3 weeks and started noticing that I was sweating quite a bit| and it was more of a cold sweat. I also had tightness in my chest| and my Asthma had flared up| and was not easily controlled after taking the rescue inhaler 4 times in an 18 hour period. I felt ill| and the pain was still there on top of all this. I stopped the medication on my own| and made an appointment with my doctor. After about 3 days I started to feel better| but I still had to work on getting my breathing back to normal| so I had to take Prednisone for a short time (5 days) to get it under control. All in all| the drug did not work| and if someone has Asthma| I would strongly caution them to ask their doctor if it would be something to worry about.,OxyCodone,45-54,Female

The pain relieving effects are probably somewhat hard to detect| but it is effective.  I am concerned about the inevitable; stepping down and becoming independant of use.  The potential for nausea is most concerning to me. Maybe even more concerning than the increased pain that is sure to follow. I try to never exceed the physician's dosage| even on those days when pain seems more severe and my schedule is more demanding.

I take one 30 mg pill every 8 to 10 hours.  It does wonders to stop pain but I have experienced some side effects. My appetite is not what it used to be. The drug also causes severe constipation| which other drugs have not been able to correct. Sometimes I also have difficulty sleeping. If I am busy and forget to take my dose at the right time| my body will soon remind me.  Withdrawal symptoms come on quickly and can be very severe. Those symptoms are sweating| hot and cold flashes| and something I would describe as something like restless leg syndrome. My muscles get very twitchy.  After resuming my dose these symptoms disappear after half an hour and everything returns to normal. Overall I am very satisfied with this medication for it is the only thing that I have had prescribed to  me that actually relieves my pain| however I wouldn't recommend it unless no other type of pain medication will work.

But this drug has also became very hard to get filled at almost all pharmacies. It seems like something that really helps your pain the DEA has really made it hard to get at your pharmacy. I know that there is people that get it to sell and it has really put people who are in really bad pain in a very bad situation. Especially these very young people who get it from doctors just to get high. But it is very unfair for the people who are in pain and really need it. So therefore it is making a persons life that is in pain very hard just to live their everyday life.,OxyCodone,45-54,Female

Almost like crack in the 80s. But I recently went through chemo treatments| 2 types of chemo-escuse my spelling-leaucuverin and oxiplatin which was pumped in through port in my chest. With this medicine i was able to work except my work didnt want me there for the three days the pump stayed on me. It helped my appetite| energy and in short I continued a normal life. Before the medicine I couldnt make it through dinner without leaving early and never eating more than half my meal|couldnt set through a movie and worst of all I would go 2-3 days without sleeping. With the meds i NOT ONLY COULD DO THINGS BUT I EVEN WOULD GO TO THE BEACH AND I HAD DROPPED 45 LBS PRE SURGERY AND ANOTHER TEN DURING HOSPITAL STAY. tHEN 7 MONTHS OF CHEMO-1ST 3 MONTHS NO MEDS| COULD NOT DO MUCH MORE THAN CLEAN MYSELF AND MOVE FROM COUCH TO BED. WITH MEDS I WENT FROM 177 TO 212 IN 4 MONTHS AND WAS ABLE TO HAVE MY LIFE BACK. mY NORMAL WEIGHT IS 215-220. SO YES THERE ARE NEGATIVES BUT I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A DR THAT GAVE MEMEDICINE TO GET MY LIFE BACK TO AS NORMAL AS POSSIBLE WITH A CHEMO PUMP HOOKED TO YOU FOR 46 HOURS AFTER SETTING IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 4 HOURS AND HAVING THE CHEMO PUMPED IN SO HARD AND FAST THAT I WOULD PISS SEVERAL TIMES WHILE HOOKED TO THE MACHINE.

Unfortunately| prolonged use will cause need for higher doses to relieve pain and when symptoms/pain becomes less| you will have to taper down the dose due to withdrawal type symptoms.

It really depends on the person| everyone is different. I think this is an overall good drug for pain. It has no Acetaminophen.

This is one of the few drugs that can even come close to helping.  I would be dead without it but it cost so much I often suffer without it and those are dangerous times both mentally and phyisically for me.  Oxycodone has such a bad stiggma attatched to it because many people abuse it to get high but a true pain patients know they can't get rid of all their pain and don't cara about getting HIGH.  The junkies will find a way to get high one way or the other but those in severe chronic pain suffer in ways that 'normies' can't imagine when they don't have proper pain pills.  This one in the 30mg form works grat for both breakthrough and long term pain.  It does constipate so eat mango and it is useless for tooth pain but overall my quality of life is so much better when I take this medicine.  I have been out for two weeks waiting for someone to help me pay for my visit and script and I've wanted to off myself over the pain.

2172,2178, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,1,I have to agree with the review I just read about avoiding it at all cost. Yes| it takes away the pain| but it works in your brain by revving up your endorphines so that you feel no pain. Taking Oxy as prescribed (however not informed of the effects upon stopping) landed me in rehab. I was put at 5mg moved to 30mg and abruptly taken off once I was well. I have never used drugs of any kind recreationally| so to find myself in rehab after going off and in turn drug seeking was mind blowing. I had stopped eating| my heart was constantly racing| couldn't sleep| couldn't leave the house| I was literally pulling my hair out...until I managed to get it prescribed again. Two days after I got it filled| I had to admit that I had become addicted| worst part being| it was through no fault of my own. Apparantly| the doctor should've weaned me back down to 0| not drop it cold turkey. I will honestly say rehab| no rehab that going off this drug in any fashion is one of the worst physically painful and mentally/emotionally disturbing feelings one can ever encounter. It takes a long| long time to start making your own endorphines after this...so if you can avoid it do so| if not be closely monitered.,OxyCodone,25-34,Female
2175,2181, Corva| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have taken oxcodone er for almost 5 years. The only effect it has on me is to kill the pain! I take 40 mg three times a day. When you first start the medication it does have some side effects that are tollerable but when it is in your system on a constant dosage there are no effects. That was the best thing about this medicine. I didnt have the nasty side effects of vicodan or loritab. This medicine works well for me I dont abuse it and without it I would not have the quality of life I have now.  I suffer from fiboralga as well as a degenterative disk disease that effects my joints. Before this medicine I had uncontrolable pain that was effecting my blood preasure. Iam very thankful for this medicine. It saddens me to hear of people who abuse this medication. Due to the effect that it makes it hard for people who need the relief have a hard time getting a dr to help them!,OxyCodone,35-44,Female

I have DDD| ruptured disk with scar tissue around the sciatic nerve at L5S1. Prior Microdiscectomy 2 years ago. This drug works better for my pain| but doesn't last as long. I also had Fibro with major muscle cramping. I take 3 different muscle relaxers| Voltaren and Klonopin daily. I can get pain free to go to sleep but If I do not redose with one or two at about 4 am and just wait until am| I feel like hit with Mack truck. Flu like symptoms| runny nose| watery eyes. Bingo| just like withdrawel. All of those years on Lortab and I could go day without. Wasn't comfortable but now I definetley have an dependance. The IR's can be chewed or dissolved under tongue for faster relief. I need somthing for the breakthrough pain and geez I'm already taking so much. I have no idea what comes next. Having radical discectomy soon| hoping the sciatica will calm down| but the DDD will never go away. Also 3 ruptured disks in neck but nerve studies say I don't need surgery there yet.

I've taken hydro 10/325's since '03 without the headache issue| so I'm not sure why the oxy's do this. Other than that| they work fairly well for my neck and back pain| but don't seem to be as effective with my TMJ/ear pain/headache pain. I have noticed my muscle relaxer's actually work better with the oxy's than the hydro's| which is a bonus since I have severe spasms. They are addictive and cause constipation| but all pain meds (THAT WORK| and some that don't work -tramadol-) have those side affects. I just wish the oxy 15's wouldn't give me the headaches. The LAST thing I need is the medication I'm taking to relieve pain giving me more pain. After so many years on hydro's though| they're just not working anymore. I doubt I'll ever be off pain meds| but I'm worried about tolerance to oxy building up quicker than it does to hydro's. What's after that? Morphine? Methadone?

The hospital never tried to contact my doctors office or verify that I had been prescribed the med! They gave me shots of subutex for my withdrawls| which made them ease up| but I could not nor could my family get me out of the hospital for 7 days! That's what happens when you make the mistake of going to the emergency room for withdrawls| never do it! Try to find another pain specialist and tell them what happened. Just a warning| even if you do not get MENTALLY addicted|you WILL get PSYCIALLY addicted! DO NOT STOP TAKING THIS OR ANY OTHER MED. YOU TAKE ON A DAILY BASIS-WITHOUT TALKING TO YOUR DOCTOR FIRST! You WILL get violently ill|there is no way around it! If you can't find a doctor|go to the E.R.You could actually die from dehydration/other complications.

2327,2333, motherloveydovey| 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have fibroid Malyasia and a pretty bad screwed up back due to an epidural gone wrong| I also have a torn ligamnets and miniscus in both knees. I have been taking 15 mg oxycodone for 2 years now. I hads to move up from the hydrocodone wich was no longer effective.  I must comment though like most people about the drug abuse.  I really do wish it would stop. I had to endure large amounts of pain for a long period of time and spend ove 1|000 dollars to find a docter willing to treat my pain. Even though I had medical records| xrays and MRI's showing facts that I am indeed in pain and have REAL medical problems.  Docters are now strict and terrfied to give anyone pain meds because of the dam abusers out there!! Its horrible! What made me the most upset was that it took me all that time and all that money to find a docter to treat me| and I have heard of junkies walking into an doc office and making up a bullcrap story and walking out with whatever meds they asked for!!! UGH!!! Anyways| for people who really need thos medicine| I highly reccomend it. It lasts a while and it helps me get up and moving throught my day. I am a divorced (and single) mother of 3| I work and attend college. It relieves my pain almost completly and I never have to double up or take it earlier than scheduled. I have not has to have my dosage upped in two years also. Its a great mnedication.,OxyCodone,25-34,Female

They switched me to oxycodone 30 Mg and it helps but they seem to not last as long as the original OC's I have been taking pain meds since 1999 I need to go ahead with the surgery on my back but I dont believe it will help me but the Oxcodone does make it where I can at least feel like getting up and trying to be somewhat productive. In a perfect world no one should take anything but it's hard when you have such pain I just wished that all the drug addicts would stop. These pills are for people who really need them not for people to abuse.

Much to my surprise| my pain has continued well beyond the amputation (why it is called ""phantom"" pain is beyond me.. its like having my sciatic nerve pinched by pliers with huge volts of electricity.)  My doctor prescribed a Fentanyl patch in the beginning then weaned me off that onto oral Oxycontin (eventually at 3x10 mg a day). I changed insurers and was told I had to take the ""generic"" version of the Oxycontin called ""Oxycodone"" if I wanted it covered by my insurance. I found I had to increase my dosage when I switched and this worried me| but could not afford to pay the full price of Oxycontin. I seemed to  find my pain relief at about 50 mg a day of Oxycodone. I'd say relief was better than the brand name version. The last time I went to my pharmacy to pick up my prescription I noticed they gave me Oxycontin (this is after a year of being on the Oxycodone.) I asked why? since it was originally not covered by me insurance? My pharmacist told me they took Oxycodone off the market because of the abuse by people using it recreationally. I also found out they changed the way the Oxycontin is formulated to prevent abuse. I made the change and experienced severe nausea and vomiting for almost 2 weeks. I am finally adjusted back to the Oxycontin| but really don't understand why the people that really need these meds have to be put on a roller coaster because of the recreational abusers.",OxyCodone,45-54,Female

Six years ago I feel and tore my 3 lower discs and have RSD down my left arm and severe pain| numbness| swelling and many other symptoms in my left leg.  This medication has been a miracle for me.  After 2 years of my accident| the doctor I was seeing said that he could no longer do anything for me but a friend of mine referred me to a Pain Management doctor.  This man saved my life.  I was suffering from severe pain| depression and anger.  It took some time to get used to the medications| but once I did| I seemed to have some form of my life back.  In the morning| I can not get out of bed with out taking 2 30mg Oxycodone| which I am only supposed to take 1| but 2 helps me function better.  Then I take my Opana ER 3 - 40mg and 1 - 20mg in the a.m. and then the same amount 12 hours later.  This is a very high does of medication I am on| but without it| I am in so much pain| which right not there is no other course of treatment for nerve damage| that I have thought of taking my life.  Before this happened| I was such an active person| with a husband| 2 small children and an elderly mother who all depended on me.  I felt totally useless| but this medication has brought me back to life.  I know that someday I may have to come off and I am not looking forward to that because working in the medical field years ago| I know what withdrawl can be like.  But as long as I can function and deal with the pain| I will stay on this as long as the doctor agrees.  Yes| I still have pain| which will never completly go away| but with his medication and can still be an active member of society.  Thank you to my doctor and the drug companies for making this medication.  But please do some more research on how to cure RSD and other types of nerve damage.

It was becomming very painful to urinate I had to push the urin out and I could not  push hard enough to hava a bowel movement. It was just too painful! I finally decided to stop the medication and most of the problem went a way in about 3 or 4 hours. I called the docter who was on call for Dr. Andersen. He thought I had sciatica and would need an MRI if the symptoms continued. I stopped the meds even though He did not reccomend that I do so. I am feeling much better today(1-17-10). ||,OxyCodone,55-64,Female

I get 60 Perocet and 45 Vicodin each month and I run out almost every month and in terrible pain when I do.  I obviously have a dependency on them but have no other way to live a half way normal life.  I have had countless surgeries over the last few years and another drawback is that the pain after that is unbearable.  Morphine and other drugs in that classification do not give much relief either.  My advice to anyone starting to take these is to take as low of a dose for as long as possible before and to FOLLOW the directions because if you don't nothing works later.,OxyCodone,35-44,Female

The docs put me on high doses of both long acting Oxycontin to short acting percocet and then would bring me down to a level post-op to settle my chronic pain levels down. The only problem is that the narcs make me feel too good and ended up putting me in rehab as I would go through a thirty day supply in a week to ten days. The withdrawal sets in and that is a whole entirely beast from hell. I have been taking Suboxone ever since getting off of the oxy's and it keeps my pain levels to a managed level and what is even better| does not make me crave the drug for more which happened on the oxy's.

2812,2820, Marlena| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,4,I was in a car accident 4 years ago| and developed chronic intractable pain in my upper back and knee. At first| I was given muscle relaxers and neurontin due to the fact that my back would start going into spasm| starting near the injury and spreading to entire back to the point where I couldn't stand up and I had to lay on ice to kill the pain. Couldn't move my arms| would start screaming when the ice pack warmed up| etc. The muscle relaxers only succeeded in knocking me unconcious for hours at a time. If I didn't take them| I would wind up calling an ambulance because being awake I could not take the pain. At the hospital| they gave me morphine| which helped but was so strong that I couldn't function. I begged the dr to put me on some pain medicine that would allow me to be awake and deal with the pain. We experimented with a couple| and this one had the least amount of side effects for me. It allowed me to remain concious and to be active enough to start rebuilding my strength. I still have chronic pain syndrome| and take 5 mg of oxycodone 4x a day| the only thing that I would complain about is the fact that it causes me constipation| which is true of any pain medicine. Others caused me migraines| acne| etc. So| for me| this is the only one that works and whose side effects are not worse than tolerating the pain!,OxyCodone,35-44,Female

2814,2822, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,2,1,hink doctors are too quick to prescribe this medication for pain. With time you become tolerant to it and have to increase the dosage to have the same pain killing effects. Even if you stick to the exact prescription amount your body becomes physically dependant upon it and it becomes very difficult to get off of due to very uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. Doctors do not warn patients of this when they prescribe it by my experience and by the time you find out it is too late ... my advice is if you can avoid taking this medication ...do so... It is very highly controlled and if you do run out for whatever reason before your next script is due| they will not prescribe you more and you will be forced to go through withdrawal syptoms| which are simply horrible ...on top of the pain from your injuries or sickness. Quite simply the pain killing abilities of this drug are very good but is it worth what you will have to go through when it is time to stop... Also it causes illeus (slowing of the bowl) and constipation.. I honestly wish i never was given any of this medication... I should have just had the surgery i was trying to avoid rather than trying to control my severe pain with these pills because i now find myself in a situation where i might have to check myself into a rehab to get off of these things ..i had never taken a single drug in my life now i find my body physicaly addicted to something i believed was going to help me.. If you can avoid it dont take these pills or you will pay for taking them if you are on them for a period of over two weeks.,OxyCodone,25-34,Male

I was miserable before I started taking the medication after arm surgery. I told my orthopedic surgeon about what I had discovered| and he told me what my PCP and GI doctors had always denied| that it was no shock to him because the drug is routinely used to control the pain and diarrhea of Crohn's. He continued prescribing not because of my arm| but because of the vast improvement in my quality of life.||The labels that are automatically affixed to you when you're on this medication are by far the worst part of being on it.  Not only do you worry about doctors judging you| but you have yourself to worry about.  It really got to me| especially since my GI doctor said that they don't use it any more for symptoms| and my PCP accused me of abusing it.  Despite the fact that my dosage hadn't changed any| and that I was indeed taking it for severe pain| I let it get to me.||I chose to come off of the medication because of all of the labels I was afraid of having thrown at me.  I regret my choice now.  I was terrified that withdrawals would be the end of the world. I have a terrible fear of nausea and vomiting| and was convinced by all medical literature that I would indeed fall victim to both.||I am happy to say that neither was an issue. I didn't really have any withdrawal effects| aside from sleeping for 2 days.  The only ill effects were the return of the disease symptoms. I was happy to convince myself that these were caused only by stopping the drug for a month or so| but it is clear that is not the case. ||I would recommend seeing a pain specialist to anyone who has to be on this for more than something temporary| as they are the only ones who won't judge| and can best help with self criticism.

This combination now lets me function| although I am in severe pain| and always will be due to both legs w/chronic lymphedema| scar tissue in groin from radiation and surgery and cellutitus and shingles from time to time I can somewhat live w/the pain. I am never pain free. Have breakthru pain at 3am almost every day. I had a choice of being so dopped up w/pain meds I could drool and not move or take enough meds so I don't scream and can somewhat function and I chose to take the pain and function. I could not and would not live w/ the pain of it all if I could not take these medications because I am not going out screaming in pain or drooling from meds to control the chronic lifelong pain I will have. These medications together work great for me w/no side effects. Doctors need to treat their patients as individual people and realize that what works for one person may not work for another. Only thru trial and error| trying different mgs and medications can you find what works for you. With all the Drs I had a ""Come to Jesus"" meeting and told them via my research they were all overmedicating me and we starting trying different combinations until we found these 4 INSTEAD of 11 medications.

2877,2885, Knowledge2010| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,"1. Anyone who has had or has ""itching"" when taking this medication or ANY medication...it means that you are ""allergic"" to it! Please tell your physician...right away!  2.  People over 60 years of age who take this need to be careful with regard to ""dizziness"" or ""off balance"" because it IS strong. Maybe they could start with ""Hydrocodone-5mg"" which is less strong yet MAY work for them. If not| then Hydrocodone 7.5mg.  3.  There is something that happens after taking this medication for a long period of time. I believe| personally| between the SEVERE PAIN(which I suffer with my back| also) and the medication| it does cause you to become ""irritable"" and ""upset"" and ""angry"" and sometimes ""depressed."" No question. But| who WOULDN'T be all of those things after suffering for SO LONG?! Only people who have had SEVERE back pain or knee pain or shoulder or neck pain| etc.| or fibromyalgia can truly understand how all of that makes you feel. NONE of us ""WANT"" to be all of those things but it| I believe| goes along with the PAIN and the MEDICATION...combined.  Be careful w/doctors because if you call and say you ran ""short"" on the medication...they will begin to ""suspect"" that something is ""off""...even if you have to wait a few days or so.  After about a year or two| Oxycodone DOES begin to ""wear off"" at the same dose you started with. That is normal. You have become ""immune"" to the same dose. That is when you must ask the doctor for at least a ""stronger strength""....NOT ""MORE!"" Ask for 10mg rather than the 5mg tablets. That happened to me. I was taking 5mg 3 times a day...one at a time. Then| it did not work. I asked for ONE extra one| to help me sleep....NO WAY! The doctor would not give it to me! Instead| he wanted to give me ""MORPHINE!!"" Can you imagine! THAT is the STRONGEST of the narcotics! I said NO!! He ""dismissed"" me! Another kind doctor started me on ""10mg...4 times per day."" That helped quite a bit more. Do NOT ask for any ""EARLIER"" from the doctor than normal!",OxyCodone,55-64,Male

Also| there have recently been shortages of this medication and I had to do a lot of calling around before I found a pharmacy that could get it. I also believe that the generics are inconsistent as to their active ingredients. Recently| it seems to be very inconsistent as ro the relief I may receive from the medication. My doctor is also very concerned about the DEA| the FDA  etc. He will not prescribe two strengths of oxy codone even though it would seeem to be much more eficient to give me a choice of srengths| say eith a 5mg. capsule or a 15 mg. tablet. (The reason being the 15 mg. tablet can only be broken into two 7.5 pieces. So| if I think I may only need 5 mg.|that's too badI will have to take a half of one 15 mg. tablet. He claims if he wrote two presriptions in varying strengths | he would almost surely be flagged for investigation by the state DEA.) Something's not right here.

2973,2982, pain relief beware| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,3,5,1,The generic form of this medication has caused me to have difficulty breathing and what doc considered anxiety attack. Beware of medication. Although I think pain meds are great for some| they are dangerous for others. I feel because I am only allowed the generic form ( insurance requirement) that this medication could have been better use if I would have been given brand name. Generics come from all over. Just be careful and hope that you will not go thru what I did. I felt like I couldn't breath and have had severe shakes from this. Also pulse problems. My pulse would flutctate from 66 beats to 148 beats to 80 beats. All within a few minutes. I now am seeing a cardiologist. I really think it is a  filler in the generic form of the medication. Not all medications are equal. The fillers for generics are not the same as for brand name medications. Report this to FDA if you have problems.|Good luck.,OxyCodone,45-54,Female

I was addicted.  I couldn't work or do anything without my bottle of pills.  Sure it helped the pain but i liked the sense of euphoria I got when I took the pills and soon my body got dependent on it.  Then one week ALL my doctors found out about each other and they ALL stopped giving me my meds and I had to go off cold turkey.  That landed me in ER and I got on a patch called CATAPRES. It's a patch that you wear that has no pain reliever but it does help with withdrawal symptoms.  It saved my life.  I am now off opiates and take OTC pills for my pain and am free.

Having suffered from back pain for about 8 years on and off I took a fall on the ice around Christmas. Began taking hydrocodone. Went from 5-650 to 10-650 until earlier this week. Twisted my back getting into the car and increased my pain by about 60%. Doc put me on this because I was taking too much of the other and was worried about my liver.

Before I started it I was barely functioning. Today I feel like I could at least cook a meal or sit for a long length of time. As far as addiction| well| I had a pretty long talk with the doc and she said that if you have chronic legitimate pain to not worry and there are ways to wean you off when and if you don't need it anymore.

I only take it when I am having pain.  This has kept me from becoming addicted like so many others have. My Dr. writes a script for 100 tabs.  This usually lasts me anywhere from 4 to 6 months and sometimes even longer.  Now to correct a misconception...Oxycodone is not Percocet| it is one of two medications in percocet| the other being acetaminophen (Tylenol).  My advise to anyone taking any narcotic...if you have an addiction| seek help immediately.  I am a nurse and have seen all to often the long term affects of users and abusers.  Life is to precious to throw away on any type of drug.  Remember medications are to heal or give relief| so if you are not sick or in pain...STOP before it is too late!,OxyCodone,35-44,Male

I have tried talking to his Dr about the addictions my husband has incurred due to these meds| but it does no use. The Dr is continuing to keep on refilling. These meds have changed my husband who I have been married to for over 10 years. He is not the same person I married and fell for. Even our children notice the different dad they now have. And its not a good thing..The drug mfg should also note with side effects comes lying| betrayal|stealing| and cheating. Whomever takes these pills seemed not to have a care in the world|they are so high on life while on these meds. We have lost our home| cars| money because of his foolish mistakes while on Oxycontin and Oxycodone| of course he takes more in the beginning of the prescription then paces himself as it gets closer to his refill.

3106,3117, glendola| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,4,5,3,I was diagnosed with pancreatitis in 2004.  I was prescribed vicotin| which didn't touch the pain.  I was the prescribed 20mg. of oxycontin.  That seemed to work incredibly| basically getting rid of 90% of the pain.  It seemed like I had my life back.  However| which is typical with opiates| your tolerance level and the need for more of it increases rapidly.  The second month| the doctor titrated to 40mg.  Again| the pain was 90% gone.  Ultimately| 2 months later he had me on 2 80mg. tablets three times daily.  At that point| I was a raging drug addict.  I didn't look for the medication for pain anymore| I just needed it so as not to go through withdrawal.  Needless to say| I ultimately had to go to a rehab| because I COULD NOT come off of them on my own.  I tried twice and I went through withdrawal that is not to be explained.  People that haven't gone through it think that it's like a hangover from drinking.  It's 10 times worse| especially the emotional aspect.  You become mad| unbelievably sad| you get a total feeling of impending doom| and if you're already pre-occupied with something| it's magnified 100 times.  Now after that horror story| I'm not saying that it's too much medicine for everybody| I'm just saying exhaust every other medication that is not opiate based| or an opiate that is much less potent.  It's DEFINITELY worth the try.  And make sure| truly| make sure it is prescribed by a PAIN MANAGEMENT doc.  General practitioners aren't aware of the damage these medications can cause.  I did abuse the medication| so if I hadn't I wouldn't have written this story| but I've heard the same story from people in which I know took at the prescribed rate.  Best of luck.,OxyCodone,35-44,Male

This new pain med (15mg oxy) along with 60mg of CR KAdian 2X a day has seemed to help ease the pain somewhat better than the Percocet alone.  I'm suffering with neck pain at C5-C6 after having surgery 2 1/2 years ago for my C6-C7 with fusion.  Now added to the neck pain I have a ""dehydrated| herniated & degenerative"" disc in low back at L5-S1|on going for past 15 months now. My Neurosurgeon will offer 1 of 2 procedures to best relieve the 'round-the-clock agonizing low back & left leg pain.  I'm diagnosed with damaged nerves running bilaterally on both legs-most damage is left side.  It seems that as each week goes by my back/leg pain gets worse and more intense.  The meds only ""take the edge off"" so I can try to function on a daily basis.  Consume LOTS of H2O & Fiber to avoid...you know!  I agree with others| it's unfortunate that there are those out there abusing pain meds| which only makes US with REAL pain feel guilty or look like ""addicts"" when asking Dr. for refills| etc.  My Dr. is GREAT & I'm lucky to have a truly caring| understanding Dr. that is willing to help me as long as it takes til I begin 2 feel better.  In summary| I would recommend a CR-controlled release 12hr capsule 2x p/day(Kadian-I'm on 60mg-U can start lower mg) along with the breakthru fast acting(15mg Oxycodone-every 4hrs)as the best possible combo for relief.  It is helping me so far (it's been about a month on this ""new"" regimen). I will have my L5-S1 surgery in Feb. 2009 so I pray for significant relief-although the pain will most likely be 10-fold throughout my recovery period| but I'm praying the long term benefit will prevail!!

I've been in tremendous pain for 20+ days.  I was given 325 mg. tabs to hold me over until an epidural.  This med has helped...but not like the epidural!  I didn't even have to take one pill for pain today (including tylenol/advil.)  I was cutting the pill in half and still reaping the benefits.  Took a full pill one time and felt sick during the night as well as dizzy.  Went back to 1/2 pill w/ no problems.  After reading some of these posts| I'm glad the epidural worked so far.

3199,3211, tlb7263| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,In my case oxycodone is about the only pain reliever that doens't produce noticeable side affects like other medications.  Hydrocodone affects my mood (irritability)| causes stomach pain (burning sensation) and keeps me from sleeping.  Oxycontin is just too strong and I found it to be highly addictive.  If taken correctly| i.e. as needed| oxycodone produces the best results for me without having to worry with becoming dependent or addicted| upset stomach or mood changes.  I find it helps my mother who also takes this medication.  She has severe rheumetiod arthritis and this is the one medication she can take and sleep| get relief and function without negative side effects.  If you take this medication correctly you will find it works and works well.  If dulling moderate to severe pain oxycodone is the one pain medication I and my mother will take with full confidence that our pain is dulled to the point of being tolerable and we don't have to worry with the side effects of the aforementioned pain relievers.  I can't emphasize this enough do not abuse this drug or take it unnecessarily and it will perform exactly as expected.,OxyCodone,45-54,Male

3214,3226, Harry-Xavier| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,4,5,4,I'm 28 and have had chronic back & neck pain since I was 20. I started on non-narcotic drugs like the anti-inflammatories but they didn't help much. Then I had the weaker opiates like codeine| dihydrocodeine and tramadol| which helped a bit but still weren't enough. I'm now on 60mg OxyContin/day| plus 5-10mg of the short-release form for breakthrough pain. It's the best painkiller I've ever used| but I still have pain all the time| just not as strong. My doc keeps offering to increase it but I don't want to as it makes me groggy and it's hard to wake up. OxyContin is supposed to last 12 hours| but it just doesn't| so instead of taking 30mg twice a day| I take a 20 when I wake up| a 10 about 6hrs later| another 20 in the evening and the other 10 around bedtime| which seems to work quite well. I've been on it daily for about 6 months now so am undoubtedly physically dependent on it. It's a very addictive drug which is why it's so tightly controlled| but there is a crucial difference between physical dependence and actual ADDICTION| which is psychological - I don't actually enjoy the effect| too much makes me feel nauseous and I have no desire to increase the dose so that doesn't concern me. It's an extremely effective painkiller but shouldn't be used for pain unless it's severe. I wouldn't take it if I wasn't in so much pain but it's undoubtedly the best painkiller I've ever had. CAUTION: NEVER take more than prescribed cause it can kill you - especially if mixed with acetaminophen (as in Percocet)| which poisons the liver. That's what killed Heath Ledger! Used as directed it's safe and effective - but the forms that are just oxycodone without anything else like acetaminophen are actually much safer| and the doses can be adjusted much more easily than in compound preparations. I find the long-release form (OxyContin) particularly convenient.,OxyCodone,25-34,Male

I have severe problems with a massive herniated disc osteophyte complex which compresses on nerves and another herniated disc and arthritis now and my scoliosis that HAD always been ""mild"" is now ""moderate"" as of July 2008 MRI!!

Because he could not ""take"" being ""WRONG!!""  I refused to go on ""morphine"" and that was it with him and myself.  It was awful.

Even though most doctors like my own was very reluctant to give it to me I do not feel that it is something that you should be afraid of taking.  If you think about becomming addicted then you will.

3404,3416, vhh001| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,4,5,4,My pain management doctor prescribes MS Contin-CR 30mg| 3 times daily along with Oxycodone 30mg every 6 hours as needed for breakthrough pain for Degenerative Disk Disease in my back and Degenerative Arthritis in both knees. I have had HIV for nearly 21 years and am healthy in regards to the HIV. I am concerned about wearing down my system by taking too much pain medication along with the HIV meds and I did not feel that I was getting ideal pain relief from the combination so I discontinued the MS Contin and now only take the Oxycodone when I feel the first sign of pain and I feel that by taking the medication this way| it works best for me. I do not take it when I don't need it. Sometimes this is not so good| because if I wait too long to take the Oxycodone I have to lie down and wait until it takes effect| but for me| I feel that this is best for my overall health. This way and I am not taking two narcotic medications at the same time. I DO NOT recommend self prescribing to anyone and highly suggest making sure your doctor approves of changes like this. My doctor is aware of how I choose to take my meds but does not approve| but I do not want to spend my life as a zombie. So| currently I take no MS Contin and take Oxycodone on the average of 3 times a day (sometimes more| sometimes less)| but I always take less than what is prescribed and feel that for the most part this is an ideal regimen for me.

3421,3433, SIETEC| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) ,3,4,2,"I took oxycodone for about 3 years (maxing out at 400 mg Oxycontin per day) for severe back pain due to multiple etiologies.  It is definately an opiate that should be in Schedule-II for it's reward-cascade and ""euphoric"" effects (thus necessitating very careful increases in dosage) but it doesn't have the pain ""stopping power"" of some of the other C-II drugs such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone) or Actiq/Duragesic (Fentanyl Citrate).  In many of the patients I see (I'm an anesthesiologist and pain/addiction specialist) I think that as far as oral medicatations go (oxycodone is not commercially available in the US as an injectable formulation) hydromorphone is one of the most effective and my experience has been that it is less ""emotionally and psychiologically"" addictive than oxycodone.  If it were my personal and professional experience rating oxycodone against other full agonist ORALLY AVAILABLE opioids| I would say that in terms of pain relief:||(I don't include fentanyl as an oral opioid since it's bioavailability is so low that it cannot simply be swallowed and be effective)||Methadone (Methadose) >> Oxymorphone (Opana) >> Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) >> OXYCODONE >> Morphine Sulfate (Avinza| MS Contin| MS-IR| etc.) >> Hydrocodone (Lortab| Vicodin| etc.) >> Meperidine (Demerol)||"">>"" meaning ""greater than""; in other words the list goes from most to least potent||As far as psychologically addictiveness (i.e. creating feelings of euphoria)| I'd rank:||Oxymorphone >> Methadone >> OXYCODONE >> Hydromorphone >> Morphine >> Hydrocodone >> Meperidine||As far as creating physical tolerance and difficulty with discontinuation/lowering dosage| here's my opinion:||Methadone >> OXYCODONE >> Hydromorphone >> Oxymorphone >> Hydrocodone >> Morphine >> Meperidine||I hope this is helpful and please always consult a physician before changing your dosages.

Oxycodone is a generic for oxycontin FYI. Then methadone then 100mg mscontin later w/ morphine tabs in between| now back on oxy-c and with me all these drugs I mentioned are only effective if you have no| or mucho decreased your activity| so I decided (as long as they only work if you don't have a real life) to reduce mgs.  Side effects are constipation| rarely any sex| fatigue when it begans wearing off at about 8 hours| and it is a 12 hour dose; HA!  Oh yeah if you decide to detox; expect 4-6 weeks withdrawls| and first 3-4 weeks are hades eventhogh your pain clinic Dr. may say 8 days.  If I knew then what I know now I would have searched high and low for any| and every alternative solution.  By the way I went thru detox cause it did only help me when I was being a couch potatoe and sleeping.  I stayed off it 5.2 months and decided it was helping more then I thought| but in those 5 months I did not research alternatives which I highly regret.

3586,3599, f150stx| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,3,3,3,I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and was put on OxyContin due to other Fibromyalgia meds not helping with the chronic pain.  The meds worked great prior to them changing it's formulation.  After the formula was changed its effectiveness went to crap.  I was back to square one.  I see a pain management doctor and he recommended Methadone due to its half life and cost effectiveness.  I did my research and went with my doctor's recommendation even though I was worried about some horror stories I read online.  In the end I'm glad I made the switch.  The monthly cost is SIGNIFICANTLY less ($10-$15 per month) and after taking the medication for 3-4 days I was able to experience its full effectiveness.  I experience less pain and use less breakthrough medication.  OxyContin worked well before the formula was changed| but after the change I felt like its effectiveness was 1/4 of what it used to be.  ||Fibromyalgia patients often get dismissed due to the inability to clearly define the root cause of the pain.  As a result| they are forced to live in pain which significantly reduces their quality of life. Everyone's body| symptoms| and effectiveness of some medications are unique.  I'm lucky and thank God every day that I have a knowledgeable| empathic| and caring pain management doctor who believes / believes in his patients.  ||To everyone experiencing chronic pain ..  I pray / send positive thoughts your way in hopes you find the relief you deserve to not only improve your quality of life but also to enable you to live your life to the fullest instead of just trudging through and merely surviving day by day.||Good luck and Godspeed!,OxyContin,25-34,Male

My own personal experience with this hazardous additive (BHT)which is not meant for human consumption was horrific. I am taking a brand of Oxycodone that has no (BHT)filler and within days literally my Gut rott passed along with my migraines.

Started on 10mg 2x a day| it barely helped| Dr. increased to 20mg 2x a day that helped for about 4 years| then had to increase to 30mg 2x a day. Recently I got used to the 30mg dose| but I could not bring Myself to increase the dose again| so I had My Dr. lower it back to 20mg. Oxycontin works great for chronic pain| except for the long term effects of being highly addictive| loss of effectiveness and side effects of Low-T| and depression.

How on earth there could be a medication *specifically* made to treat long term| chronic pain and the prescribers and pharmacists are afraid to use it. I think I have tried just about every pain medication there is on the market and nothing works to relieve my pain like OxyContin. I am moving soon and of course will be changing doctors and pharmacies - I just hope I find a sympathetic doctor who's not afraid of the prescribing-police!

I was put on oxycontin and over a year had my dose adjusted to 2x 60mg per day with 20mg of liquid oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Because I'm on blood thinners| opioid painkillers are the only option for me. This medicine does work to reduce pain| and it is easy to use in the sense that you just take a couple of pills.

On the one hand| this medication has enabled me to keep my job and get around for the past year| for which I am grateful| but I am scared about what it might have done to my brain in terms of physical dependence.

I didn't realise beforehand that it could cause such bad withdrawals| I was told if you take it as prescribed you wouldn't get addicted| but they didn't qualify that you could still be physically dependent on the medication in the sense that you go through awful withdrawals without it| even if you aren't mentally addicted.

3649,3662, Pokey| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,3,5,3,Always take the minimum dose possible so you don't crash into the abyss of pain when the pharmacy runs out or the doctor refuses to refill or whatever. If possible| take a complete meds holiday| during which time (a day| a week) you taper off your dose to a minimal dose or none at all while being closely watched per your pain (under your doctor's guidance). Meaning| do as little as possible to aggravate things... stay in bed and watch comedy movies or whatever while eating ice cream or hot cocoa and cookies. This allows your body to re-set itself so you are less likely to build tolerance. But you may also find the side effects start anew also... |For those who can't get this Rx'd| try Ultram. It is the best pain med for me| I just have to take in small doses so it doesn't wreck my stomach| much like the useless NSAIDS do. |Methadone is a lot better than nothing as well. For guys who refuse it due to how it decreases your libido| ask yourself which is more important| pain relief or having sex. If you choose sex| you don't need these meds anyway... JMHO.|And never| ever abuse or share this med; that's what makes it so hard for those of us with truly intractable pain to get it!||And once again| try Ultram or Methadone if that's the only choice. Ultram is the best pain med I have ever used in my 27 years fighting 24/7 pain. And if your doctor will prescribe methadone or nothing at all| for heaven's sake| take Methadone! The hit it takes on libido will be gone within a week that you stop taking it| so don't let that side effect keep you from pain relief.||And with Oxycodone| as with methadone| watch out for falling asleep.. DO NOT OPERATE MACHINERY| DRIVE| HOLD A BABY| ETC. UNTIL YOU'RE SURE OF HOW THE MED AFFECTS YOU! Fortunately| Ultram has the opposite effect on me; it wakes my otherwise sleepy brain up.

3655,3668, Too Much Pain| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,2,3,1,After having an Interior Lumbar Fusion in May of 2008 and ending up with more pain that I ever thought a person could be in| this medication is barely providing 3 hours of relief.  I am currently taking only 2 of the 80mg pills| with no oxycodone 30mg for break-thru pain anymore due to having at least 3 pain doctors getting closed down for giving meds to people who clearly didn't need it.  Those doctors only wanted the money so now I am like so many others who need a pain doctor but cannot find one in the state of Alabama.  I am in desperate need of a doctor to give me the meds I need to deal with this unbearable back pain.  Before this med was originally changed| it worked great! Now it's just a cruel joke with way too many bad side effects.  I have also been to at least 10 other surgeons for help| only to be told they could not help me.  I have done everything they all suggested with no real results.  My only option is to stick with this med as I will not take Methadone or a Fentanyl patch for fear of an overdose.  I will not let my son find me dead due to one of those meds!  I don't know all the details| but I do know people who have died while on those.  I have never abused any medication I have taken and do not drink or use street drugs.  Never failed any drug test.  If anyone knows of a doctor anywhere in Alabama or a state close by that can help me| PLEASE respond to this post.  My family doctor will not keep giving this to me and is only doing so until I can find another doctor.  I have been looking for over a year with no luck.  He knows this as he has to make any referrals to the doctors I HAVE TO FIND ON MY OWN.  They all say they are not taking new patients| do not write these meds| or something else that gets another door slammed in my face.  I have been through all the injections| physical therapy| and many other procedures so please don't suggest those.  Like I said| I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THE DOCTORS AND SURGEONS HAVE SAID TO DO!!  THANKS TO ALL!!,OxyContin,35-44,Female

3678,3691, RodK| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,4,4,I have suffered from chronic pain most of my life.  It began when I was twenty years old.  Veterans Administration hospital surgeons performed multiple surgeries on my left leg.  The final result was the removal of a four-inch section of my fibula and ever-increasing pain in my left ankle region.  For nearly forty years I treated my pain with aspirin based pain relievers| due to my aversion to narcotics.  In my fifty-ninth year I was diagnosed with a stomach ulcer as a result of prolonged aspirin usage.  I will be on medication for the rest of my life to treat the ulcer.  At this time| my primary care doctor prescribed Vicodin for pain management.  Even though this was not as effective as aspirin| it was decreasing the pain to a level that allows me to live a somewhat normal life.  However| due to the nature of the drug| I was on a roller-coaster| alternating between decreased pain and increased pain as the medication would take effect and decrease in effectiveness between dosages.  At this point| my doctor changed the medication to Oxycontin.  The nature of this drug is to take me to a level of relief for a longer period of time| due to its time-released nature.  It is often referred to as a âtwelve-hourâ drug.  This means that it gradually enters the bloodstream and then provides relief over a sustained period of time before decreasing in strength.  This process takes place over a twelve-hour period.  Many believe that the proper dosage is two a day.  However| that only limits the roller-coaster ride to two periods of increased pain a day.  Thus| my doctor prescribes four a day for me.  At this dosage I am able to experience a consistent level of pain relief.,OxyContin,55-64,Male

3702,3715, BecauseIcare.| 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month,1,1,1,"This drug does have its proper uses. Acute and terminal pain. It has a very high dependency and addiction rate along with a severe psychological dependency. Opiates have been around for thousands of years and when used for the right purposes it works great. The problems that stem from prolonged use can be very detrimental to the user. Opiates attach themselves to several area's of the brain| blocking the body's natural abilities to ""feel""| ""deal"" and ""heal"". There ARE cases whereas long term use is necessary|however| the issue is in most cases it's not. After a few month's of use| you WILL become dependent on this drug physically and emotionally. After that| the user's ability to ""cope"" with everyday issues becomes uncensored if you will. You will begin to lose your identity of the ""self"" and go into mode-operative. You will begin to see serious issues that need your attention become not so important anymore. An "" I DON""T GIVE A CRAP"" ideology if you will| will begin to emerge. In other words| you stop ""feeling"". The drug becomes your everything coping mechanism. There are many other healthy choices to make when dealing with chronic pain issues. And in my opinion| many of today's chronic pain is related or stems from ones lack of ability to process negative EMOTIONS.

The only problem I am having is Doctors| other than my P.C.P.| tell me to stop taking this drug {Oxycontin} because it is a bad drug. They won't tell me what the degitive problems are. I sometimes fell they really don't know themselves and I believe they should not force their beleives on Patients who are in need for something that works for them. I at least am able to walk| move with little pain| able to do some house work. Before taking Oxycontin I was not able to do any of the above. Sometimes I just can't understand where these Doctors are coming from when they don't even know what's wrong with you. They just look at your information and when they see Oxycontin they talk to you as if you are doing something illegal. I'm not even on a large dose compare to what some other Patients are taking. If it improves their quality of life and  they are able to live some what of a normal life without that awful pain than what is so wrong? I know what that pain is like and you cannot do anything when it attacks you and that is what it feels like| something attacking you. You have no control over it| so taking something that makes it go away for awhile I feel is wonderful. Sorry for those who do not agree with me.

When i was in the hospital my pain was under control then when i left the hospital and got my meds through out patient pharm. it totally changed. Come to find out the formulations for the oxycontin was different than those from the in patient pharm. So I've done my research and I find it absolutly ridiculous that this drug was taken off the market to be replaced with a possible cancer causing formula that in all honesty doesnt work even half as good... And why was this done? So people wouldnt abuse it anymore? I mean come on people there are so many differnet types of medications that have the same exact affect on these abusers. So the only people who are suffering in my opinion are us who need this drug and not the abusers. Lets be real everyone knows that an addict is going to find a way to get their fix through hell or high water. What i would love to see is for whoever the hell it is who got this banned to wake up and realize that by taking the better and more affective drug off the market is doing nothing to the abusers. NOTHING!! Inconsiderate if you ask me. To put a drug on the market that can cause cancer| but it's okay because they can sleep better at night knowing people aren't getting high on the old formula. Instead years down the road us who need this drug and need to continue to take it will develope cancer while these abusers are still getting high on heroin or some other med. SOOO what do we do? aaahhh! haha I guess nothing but roll over and get cancer shoved straight up our ... IDK just idiotic and stupid. It makes me think that there is some kind of hidden agenda here. I mean really it makes no sense to take it off the market and start dispensing cancer instead. Its obvious that by taking it off the market it will increase heroin sales. So maybe these corps or ""someone who matters"" has their fingeres in the dope game?? IDK.. It's something to think about.",OxyContin,35-44,Male

Doctor increased the amount and that was when the seizures started. No warning. It builds up in your system according to the hospital doctor when I was admitted. I had no idea of this but was still much in pain. Also| note that my granddaughter was put on this when she was in an accident and a bone in her back broken. She was 22 years old and a new beride of 4 months. Her husband found her dead in bed. Autopsy showed buildup of oxycontin so great that her body could not be embalm her for burial.  It is a very DANAGEROUS DRUG. My 'new doctor' put me on Oxycodone with no fillers and it works without the problems of Oxycontin. 15 mg of Oxycodone 3x a day works wonders for me.

4023,4037, drchiptravis| 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,5,4,5,after reading some of the reviews| I am very different from most of the reviewers| in that i am taking it for pain after a total knee replacement| and therefore have a nebulous future date of no use at all. Unfortunately| this drug is a favorit street drug and thus has a bad rep. It's rep as being addictive causes people like me to restrict our use until the pain gets really bad| when it is best used to keep the pain a level that allows for useful rehab exercises and stretches to be done. Too much pain inhibits the muscles from proper function. For you patients who have conditions that cause pain as a symptome| please try to find an alternative care doctor knowledgeable in chiropractic| acupuncture| nutritional supplements| massage| and exercise (not necessary to be able to do all these| but as a guide to use). If all you are doing for your problem is to take oxy| then you will always be on it. While it is working try a natural approach as an adjunctive. They work well in many cases. I am a chiropractor with the knowledges mentioned above| and until the knee surgery was taking no drugs at all| for anything. Don't give up.,OxyContin,65-74,Male

4027,4041, thx2u| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) ,1,1,1,I am writing this review as a caregiver from a husband about his wife. After living with my wife in chronic pain for the past 8 years she had finally tried Oxycontin OC in Dec. 2009. It was the best medication ever given to her out of the many ones she had tried during her 6 yrs of going to pain management Dr's. It actually gave me my wife back to me. She felt normal again| and was able to go to family functions and do some miner things like housework and cook meals and visit her family all while feeling good| and free from majority of the pain. |These are things that are taken for granted sometimes by people not living with chronic pain. It all went downhill in Sept.2010 when this medication was changed without warning to a new medication called Oxycontin OP. It even has a new look. It had bad side effects for her. Sometimes the medication would not even work and pass right through her. She was prescribed 3 a day and she would start falling asleep and could not move| and having severe headaches| blurred vision and all of this started with the new pill.|It's a shame they could not have come up with a better way to acomplish what they were trying to do with these pills than using this glue. They are obviously not breaking down the same as before. It's also a shame that honest chronic pain people had to pay the price for those that abused medications| and those people will continue to abuse the new pills and any others they can get there hands on.|So we are 1 time to the ER| and 6 visits to Pain management in the 3 months now trying to find another pain medication combination to give her the relief and life back that she deserves. We are very discouraged with the Perdue drug company| and at this point will not take any medication that they manufacture. Shame on you !!,OxyContin,45-54,Male

I did go back to my doctor| (in a major Pain Clinic)| and they swear up and down that they knew nothing about the new ""OP"" meds until they heard about it through the patient complaints. And now the complaints are pouring in. Doc said I was one of the first to report it but now there are multiple pain doctors with multiple patients each that are reporting problems. My doctor increased my Oxycodone I.R. dosage and that has helped with the pain control. But it's nothing close to how the ""OC""'s took care of it. Taking 2 of the 30mg I'R's| the pain returns 2-4 hours later. I try not to take the ""OP""'s because of how they make me feel. Nauseated| feeling ""odd"" is the only way I know how to put it| and then there's the bowel issue. Before| with the ""OC""'s| I was as regular as clockwork. (I take Senna-S daily at a specific time) Now| my bowel habits go from one extreme to the other. That is one issue that affects my life in a big way. And as far as pain control and the ""OP""| I don't get anywhere near the same pain relief as compared to the ""OC""s.

I really appreciate that they are working on trying to make this harder to abuse.  But is sure has affected my ablilty to function.  The makers of Oxycontin (Purdue Pharma) have seen numerous law suits saying that their drug killed someones son or daughter.  The truth is that these people that have died from ABUSING oxy's would have died from abusing something else.  So why in the world should the rest of us that have the unfortunate need to control our pain suffer from the actions of just a few IDIOTS (IE:Junkies| Government| and idiot people)  I suggest complaining to the FDA and to you congressman and senator about it.

Last month when I went to pick up my perscription I was informed that the pill would have a much thicker coating on it due to the misuse of people shooting it up. It was to easy for them to crush up and do whatever they do.

I worked with my primary care dr for years to find this life changing drug. i know the abuse factor is relevant to the changes but cant we please find a way to help those who really need this medicine instead of me having to suffer so at the age of 54 when this medicine enhances my pain relief. Please tell me what i can do. i dont want to take more than i do now. i use to take meds for breakthrough pain but stopped that because i didnt want to become dependent on 2 medications although they helped but i didnt want to combine for obvious reasons.

I called the pharmacist| and he told me this is my first bottle of the newly revised ""OP"" version of the med.  The manufacturer changed a wonderful chronic pain medication to reduce the chance of people using the drug inappropriately.  I thought:  no big deal| I don't need to crush the pill or abuse it like those drug addicts; I just need it for legitimate pain relief.  Today| I have major stomach problems and feel like I'm going to throw up.  After taking the pill this morning| it felt like it was stuck in my esophagus| so I ate some food to help get it further down in my stomach.  Then| it felt like there was a brick in my stomach.  Those things are bad enough| but the worst part is that I'm now in lots of PAIN despite taking the extremely expensive medicine.  The newly formatted pills DO NOT work.  I read that it contains some type of polymer that is in plastic and finger nail polish.  Maybe the pills go right through the body without dissolving?  We need the original formula back!  If anyone hears of a class action law suit against the manufacturer| please let me know.  Us Chronic Pain Patients have to stick together.  As for now| Iâll have to ask my pain mngt doctor to prescribe something elseâ¦.",OxyContin,45-54,Male

I believe PURDUE knew what they were doing long before we got the new medicine. They would pay their fine and change the main ingredient of the pill OC and the Gov. wouldn't follow up with the overdosses. Now what do the cronic pain suffers do.

4144,4158, dagwoodbowser| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,1,2,1,I have been prescribed Oxycontin since 2003. Started at 40MGs twice a day and in the last few years were moved up to 80MGs 2 times a day. The old OC medicine was a real miracle. I am in my 40âs and already had a knee joint replacement. My other knee is at a Stage 4 of Osteoarthritis and will also be replaced. With OC I was able to walk and do many activities. A few weeks ago my Prescription was refilled| but I got the new formulation| OP. Within a few days I began to have acute headaches| dizziness and 4th of July bowl explosions of chronic diarrhea! Worse yet| no pain relief what so ever. I went back to my doctor and he said that one of the new ingredients is actually a Laxative? After researching this further I found whatâs in this new formulation.|(BHT) it is an additive in cosmetics| pharmaceuticals| jet fuels| rubber| petroleum products| electrical transformer oil| and embalming fluid. |  |Polyethylene Oxide. It is the basis of a number of laxatives (e.g.| macrogol-containing products such as Movicol and polyethylene glycol 3350| or SoftLax| MiraLAX or GlycoLax). It is the basis of many skin creams| as cetomacrogol| and sexual lubricants| frequently combined with glycerin. Whole bowel irrigation (polyethylene glycol with added electrolytes) is used for bowel preparation before surgery or colonoscopy |  |Titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen. It is widely used to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints| plastics| papers| inks| foods| and toothpastes. It is also used in cosmetic and skin care products| and it is present in almost every sun block| where it helps protect the skin from ultraviolet light. |  |The reason Purdue changed the name from OC to OP is because it stands for OxyPoison! $1200 is not worth it and I will Never take it again.,OxyContin,45-54,Male

I went through so much constant| uncontrolled pain before the doctor prescribed the OxyContin. I was so grateful and I felt I was finally in contol of my pain| instead of the other way around. When I filled my prescription about two weeks ago| I noticed the physical difference in the meds. But I immediately saw that it was not a generic brand and that Purdue was still making them| and I went on home. (pharmacist confirmed that as well) I didn't notice a major difference until about 18-24 hours after I started taking these ""OP""-types. I started getting muscle cramps| charlie-horses| muscle spasms| whatever you want to call them| all over. My hands| feet| legs and inner thighs| (VERY painful)| started spasming. And the sweating started. Hot| cold| hot. I'm not in contol of my pain now. After 3 days I was miserable and called my doctor. They said they hadn't gotten any negative feedback and didn't know why I was having these problems.  I called Purdue and filed a report and also talked to their ""Medical Inquiries"" Dept. They| (3 different people) at Purdue said they hadn't received any other negative feedback and said they din't know why I was having these issues| but that they would ""file the report"". These calls to Purdue were on the 24th and 28th of Sept| 2010. I have since insisted on making an appt. with my doctor to figure this out. But now| I get on WebMD and see all these reports and comments about similar problems and it's ""news"" to the doctors' and Purdue? Folks| I take mine as prescribed. I don't smoke| at all. I don't drink| at all. And I sure don't do any of those street drugs. All I asked for was pain control. I didn't think I had to ask for honesty with that order of pain control.

4176,4190, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,3,2,2,"I was given oxycontin about seven yrs. ago and i had great sucess with my pain relief until two months ago with Perdue changed the way in which they were produced. After talking to a pharmaist there at Perdue they said that the only test they did on the new OP oxycontin was that ""ONE"" PILL was given to a ""HEALTHY"" individual. Why would they test a medicine that is used for pain relief on a healthy person. Then for the FDA to give the company the ok to produce this new formalated was wrong. As a patient and if you find that this new version of the Oxycontin doesn't work as well as they did before you should contact the FDA and voice your opinion that this new product is not as effective as the old ones. The number for the FDA is 1-800-332-1088. They don't even know what the long term effects that this new formula will have on individuals. But if the FDA can't even have a recall on our eggs for two years how can they give the ok on this medicine. So if this medicine is not working as before make the call.",OxyContin,45-54,Female

I have had 2 surgeries with no success. The new formula gives me severe headaches and nausea. I have been bed ridden since i started taking them.  I have spoken to the pharmicist and she said that all pharmacies will be going to these pills.

4178,4192, noblegases| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,2,3,1,The newly reformulated OxyContin is a nightmare. It is not controlling my pain. I have nausea| fevers and constipation. I am probably with drawing. I have stage 4 breast cancer with mets to liver and bone. I have bone and liver pain. I had a much higher quality of life. I was able to bicycle a mile a day and exercise. I am now more bedridden and do not travel as far away from my home. This is a toxic drug. I feel like it has the narcotic equivalent of Antabus in it. I literally have an aversion to taking it.It is also using liver pathways that it previously did not. Oxycontin was used with patients that have liver metastatis to aviod burden to the liver. Now the drug is using pathways my chemotherapy uses. I hope it is not reducing my chemos affect.  It is also rendering my break through pain meds ineffective.,OxyContin,45-54,Female

I will have to go back to finding something that works as well| The fear here is that if you complain about the new ones everyone is going to assume you just want the old one's back to abuse ! not true I never took them anyway but by mouth and for the one person who said they work fine for them and that the rest of us aren't fooling anyone SHAME ON YOU! there might be some false people writing here but i don't believe all these statements are false .

BUTT now with the OP pill it is worst than any generic brand| and also it has caused my stomach to stop up like b-4 when PURDUE  wanted to save money and make a sub-standard pill and like then my $ amount didn't go down when the quality went down. Keep the same med. like b-4 and drug test the ones you think are selling or snorting the d pill.

4187,4201, OPnogood4me | 35-44 Female  (Patient) ,1,1,1,I started on the new OP/40mgs 3 a day on 9/6. I didn't notice that it wasn't working as well but by 9/14 became violently ill to my stomach after days of constipation which was controlled on the old formula as I was on the same dose for 9 of over 11yrs. Since 9/14 I haven't been able to take more than 2 a day and can't even take my Percocet for breakthrough pain as prescribed. 9/14 started vomiting| the next day woke up to feel flu like symptoms w/ a fever| still having stomach problems as today is day 18. I just called my doctor and will call/email Purdue and the FDA. I was amazed to read on here that Purdue actually told someone it was only trialed on 133 patients on 20mgs only? OMG| I've had RSD for over 11yrs and am severely allergic to all other long acting opiates that have ever been prescribed to me. I couldn't immediately tell until a few days into it that I am going through withdrawals causing the flu like symptoms and also having extreme dizziness. I hoped this new OP would keep the abusers away while protecting our medication but if this doesn't change| there is no way many of us will be able to keep taking this and I also pay full price; $570 a month in the donut/gap of Medicare Part D 8mos of the year. I wanted to report my own problems as too many of true CP patients are experiencing this. My stomach is way too sensitive to take what I am supposed to after only 5 days of it. I have thought that we could possibly be withdrawing from the old compounds of OC's as they have to be different in the OP version. I can't take it anymore; going to my doctor today.,OxyContin,35-44,Female

I was totally non functioning.  I have been a chronic pain person for a long tome and have been using the old formula oxycotin for almost two years and it gave me great relief and I was able to function. again I will have to find another alternative unless they make available the old formula to those of us that rely on its positive benefit.  When I called the company and talked to the on line nurse to take my complaints she said that the new process began in April and was put out for distribution on Aug 9| 2010 and that a double blind study was done of only 133 patients for two weeks and that was for oxycotin 20mg only.  A big problem is that the new ingredients or aditives are different for each increase in dosage so the  formula is to my understanding different for 10mg as it is for 20mg and so on. the study is inconclusive at best and basicaly will affect many of us in many different ways as far as positive pain management is concerned. I feel that prude  has not taken into consideration the negative impact of changing the formula on those of us that depend highly on oxycotin for legitmate pain relief. I plan to contact the company again tomorrow during normal business hours and file a formal compliant with the FDA and may even contact an attorney because of the hardship of not being pain free will create for me| my family and those around me as I struggle to manage my pain.

This last refill| I was given the (OP) version| and I took my first pill and felt nothing in relief. I ended up taking FIVE 40mg pills before my pain went from an 8 to a 4.  I was in another recent car accident| so my pain level has increased| but come on! There is no way I would need to increase my dosage this much for pain relief.  I was taking four 40mg pills a day. Now I need to take 8-10. I have to go see my pain dr. in two days and explain why I am almost out of my pills in such a short time (should be fun) but I could not tolerate the pain| lack of sleep| inability to work| etc.  I don't understand how Purdue could screw up this bad on such a fantastic pain medication.

4254,4268, DC| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,4,5,3,I always say if I did not have pain I would know that I had died and gone to heaven.  I have been on Morphine| Methadone| Fentanyl for over the last 15 years spinal injures resulting in chronic pain with acute episodes. I have found that Medical Marijuana(prescribed) has been the most effective relief thus far| and the safest for my body long range| but the side effects leave me somewhat insecure with the fear of being immobilized if a situation arises where I need to be able to function at my optimum.  The Oxycontin has been helpful in suppressing some of the pain where I can function with a clear ahead.  My only concern is how long it will take until my tolerances rise and a stronger dose is called upon. Example| with the Morphine| I was up to 1000 mg a day before I switched to another pain management drug.  For right now| the Oxycontin is doing what it is supposed to do for the most part.  Any relief where I can think about tomorrow and what I can do is a gift.  So| so far| fingers crossed and optimistic for today.  It could always be worse| so I try to count my blessings.

I took it 40mg 3 times a day up until three months ago. It has given me my life back. I can not walk without it but| I still have breakthrough pain. i know that this drug is very highly addictive and if someone were to misuese the drug| it could kill them. But| I have read a lot of medical journals and l ooked up things on the Internet and they all say that if you take the drug for pain relief and not to get high| then you will likely not be too addicted to it. If you just stop it you will have withdrawl symptoms but that is because your body is used to having it and now it doesn't. It is just like alcohol or cigarettes| if you smoke fore fifteen years and just stop you will go through withdrawls.

It stops the pain and I am able to walk. Without it I would be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life and I would be in extreme pain.

4281,4295, cindygail43| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,5,5,I've been on this medication before| and just recently went back on it because my osteoarthritis has become much worse| I was in more pain on my previous medication before I switched to this medication. But I just had it filled yesterday| and the Pharmacy didn't have what I take which is 80 mgs.| so they substituted the 80 mgs. for (2)two 40's. I take (2)two a day. But what I'm wondering is will these 40 mgs help just as well as the 80 mgs? Because it seems to me that the 40 mgs doesn't seem to last the 12 hours that they are supposed to.They are actually Oxycodone 40 mgs.ER Tablets|which I believe means Extended Release. But what I was taking before was a form of morphine and another form of morphine in smaller mgs for the breakthrough pain. Which I'm also taking a form of the Oxycodone 5 mgs IMM REL| which I believe means Immediate Release. And I take (1)one of them every (4)four hours as needed for breakthrough pain. But my husband seems to think that I'm actually doing much better than when I was on the morphine medication. He says that I act alot better and I'm more like my old self| so I believe I will remain on this regimen. The side effects are: constipation| sometimes they keep me awake| and itching but the 80 mgs didn't make me itch at all| but the 40 mgs do. This regimen is working much better for me| I actually feel much better than what I was on before|and I am more active than before|by far. 7-6-2010,OxyContin,45-54,Female

4318,4332, finallysober| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,1,5,1,I started taking oxycontin 20mg 5 years ago for sciatica. At first it was great to have the pain relief| but after about the first year I needed to increase dosage due to withdrawal symptoms between doses. This is when my life went downhill. I was on 80mg twice a day and that script would only last me about 10 days due to abuse of it. I was so addicted that I was spending thousands of dollars a month getting it on the street. The ironic thing is that it made my back pain worse at this point due to constipation pressure in the lower back area. I nearly lost everything in my life that matters to me. The constant withdrawals kept me in bed for days at a time| only to spend more money to ease the w/d symptoms. It is the most addictive drug on the planet. I think that if you have common pain like most people| this is the worst drug you can get on. It will ruin your life trust me. The people who say it is good for them are addicts and they dont even know it. Unless you have a terminal disease or one that causes pain on a 10 scale| DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG. You will lose everything in your life and become a junkie. I am now on suboxone (Thank god) and have a normal life again. Again| this drug is not for you people that whine about a little back pain.

My Doc added 60mg 4x daily and doubled my Roxicodone script about 2 years ago. I have DDD and she found 4 fractured vertabrae this past summer. I also have been taking 10mgs of Valium 4x daily for many years and it enhances any pain meds I take. At my last visit just a week ago she added 8mg of Hydromorphone for breakthrough. So you can see I take a large amount of powerful meds. It didn't seem that I was developing a tolerance to the Oxycontin but my pain seemed to be getting worse by the month. Oxycontin is a very effective drug when taken as prescribed. It may take your Doc a few visits to titrate your dosage but hang in there-it's worth it. The only side effect I have experienced is constipation. I think that comes with all opiods. A word of advise; DO NOT TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU TAKE.

After 2 years at this level| I still get great pain relief and I have absolutely NO side effects. The key here is to NEVER EVER deviate from your doctorâs script. These doses are timed to give max relief throughout the day and night. I hear stories about people that tell me it doesn't work anymore only to find out that they are taking more than they should and running out of the medication sometimes several days before Federal law will allow a new script to be refilled. This is a very dangerous and just plain stupid thing to do! Once again| you abuse a very helpful drug and make it look like everyone that uses this medication is doing the same thing. Doctors are facing more and more pressure every month to get their patients off this medication and substitute it for something cheaper. Do not abuse the trust of your doctor and especially those of us that depend upon this medication to lead a somewhat normal life. Your actions put your life in danger. One of the side effects from rapid decrease in dosage is DEATH! ||I beg all of those who use this medication for severe chronic pain to please continue to follow the rules set forth between you and your doctor so those of us that need this medication can continue to receive it. With the new healthcare bill| I am scared to death that we will be on the chopping block first due to the cost of pain management. I pray that I am wrong| but has this so called ""President"" done anything logical lately? Please hang in there and follow the directions so we can remain as pain free as possible and enjoy our lives to the fullest!||God Bless you all!|",OxyContin,35-44,Male

He was perscribed oxycontin for a severe back injury.  After three surgeries| doctors said they would not advise surgery again unless he was crippled. After 10+ years on this drug he was addicted and needed more and more to combat the pain.  Needless to say| Oxycontin finally took his life when his breathing became so shallow and finally his heart stopped.  Although he had detoxed and had been off the drug for almost a year| the autopsy showed severe damage his liver and kidneys which they suspect was caused from this drug. I know people suffer from many severe pain issues as I have seen this first hand.  However| I think doctors need to be more stringent in their approach to increasing dosage| patient monitoring and patients need to be made aware of the long term effects.,OxyContin,45-54,Female

Addiction involves the progression of acute drug use to the development of drug-seeking behavior| and the decreased| slowed ability to respond to naturally rewarding stimuli.

I went down hill after that. They said there is nothing they can do for me. Not even the new disc. I went to NYC and talked with the doc that brought it over from Europe! Frank P. Cammisa MD. Anyway| I use the Oxy from my pain doc. I started out small and didn't want to take it after hearing the bad things about it. But I see it is the addicts that make it bad for real pain suffer's. I am on a mail program where they send it to you every 90 days. They make you wait 3 to 5 days before you get your 90 day supply in the mail and I run out after 90 days and I think I go into withdrawal. Is anyone having that same problem with the mail order? My insurance makes me deal with them. If I go to a local drug store like CVS etc they want $4|000.00 and the mail order is $65.00. Is thius a racket or what?It sure seems thatway to me. My doc gave me break through pain medication but it just isn't the same. He said it would keep me from going into withdrawal. I do not know but I sure feel awful. My life stops again cold in the tracks when I run out and have to wait 92 to 95 days for my new RX. We really haven't found the break through medication that works for me yet. I have been taking this med for 7 years and I wouldn't have a life if it wasn't for it. I so wished they would follow me around with a camera for 90 days and put it on TV and really show how a person in chronic pain life is. I wish this on no one. It kinda sucks for me that this drug rules my life though. I hate that part. I have to plan around my medication. Sometimes I miss doing things with friends and family because I just cannot do it without my med. I guess it is a catch 22 but I choose it.

I currently take 200mgs each morning & nite & another 120 to 160mgs during the daytime hours. I can tell you first hand this has been the best pain killer yet after nerve damage to the s1 nerve from being rear ended @60mph & I was at a dead stop with turn signal on & headlights. All the other meds made me groggy|Stupid| and pretty much a total jerk !. But after doc's put me on this drug my whole life turned for the better in an instant. without it I am pretty much bed-ridden. and YES the people who abuse this drug DO MAKE IT HARDER for the people that actually need it aka...Urin test| more frequent office visits But for the pain relief?

However| when you no longer have the pain and are ready to stop taking the pain meds| it can feel like you are trapped. The withdrawls from this drug are indescribable.  If you have experienced them you know what I mean. Thankfully| there is a drug out there that can help. My doctor prescribed suboxone to me to replace the OC.  It is truly amazing.  It took 2 weeks of taking the suboxone| gradually lowering the dose every couple days| and I was off for good. To anyone who is familiar with my experience| don't wait| get off the OC and feel whole again!,OxyContin,25-34,Male
4567,4582, CancerSurvivor| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,4,4,I survived 18 months of chemotherapy for cancer| which left me in chronic pain which one or two doctors finally called fibromyalgia| but which I doubt.  Failed lumbar disc removal from 1980. Fibromyalgia.  Two ankle breakages.  15 months ago I suffered the worst: anterior intervetrabal lumbar surgery & fusions. That means incision in front (anterior) & back (posterior).  Finally| I'm taking now only 10 mg daily of oxycontin| with a little Percocet to boost.  Oxy is the most effect pain killed I've had in over 30 years| although I'm afraid of becoming psychologically addicted to it.  Obviously| I'm physically addicted as I've tried to quit about 4 times in the past 12 months.  Am down from 40 mg. to 10 mg.  I hate to think I'll have to take Oxy the rest of my life| but it's the most effective help I've had in 30 years.|It makes me angry that some pain drs demand urine tests as if pain-sufferers are criminals.

It took 2 and a half years of my doctors trying different pain medications before a new doctor put me on Oxycontin. My pain level was a easy 8/10 on a different pain meds. I was on a 40 mg extended realese tab twice daily. within 3 days my pain was a comfortable 4.5 to 6 out of 10. This medication allowed me to do the brutal rehab work that I needed to ever walk again.

I also have degenerative ostoearthritis of T11|12 and fibromyalgia. Oxycontin has been a lifesaver| it does not eliminate the pain but it is less intense so I can at least get out of bed and move around a lot better. My Dr. does not think that it should be working for me any more since I have been on it for 4 years but she is wrong| I would not be able to function without it. Yes it is an addiction but the pain is extreme when I try to go without it. It has been a lifesaver along with my every 3 month injections into my back. I often times feel that I need to take it more than twice a day but the Dr. says no. I wish that the doctors could experience what it is like before they make a judgement. All in all I am a grat fan of the relief that I get from oxycontin| my pain level goes from an 8 or 9 to a 4 to 6.,OxyContin,55-64,Female

For people who use oxycontin the way it is prescribed| it helps better than any other pain medicine that I have taken over the years. After my spine surgery in 2004 I thought I would be OK and able to stop taking it. Sometime 5-6 months after my surgery| I started having pain again in my low back. I have numerous herniations| degenerated spine| spinal stenosis|bilaterial facet joint arthropathy & bone spurs. My arthritis Dr believes scar tissue from my spine surgery is playing havoc with my body. I agree. I go to the supermarket and church and that's about it. In 2005| I weaned off and down to 10mg but the pain progressiverly got worse and I had to gradually go back up.I am taking 40mg AM & PM. When I awake in the AM and the meds are past due| I am almost paralyzed and can't make it downstairs until after the meds go thru my body. After taking my I usually go back to sleep and can move about in an hour or two after taking the meds. I bring applesauce upstairs at night to take my medicine when I awake b/c it is too hard to walk downstairs in the morning to get something on my stomach. There is so many days that my pain level is so high that I can't do anything but stay in the bed. Imagine this strong drug and when my pain is severe that the medication doesn't take it away. People don't understand when you have multiple problems in my T & L Spine. I recently went on Prednisone for 5 days b/c I couldn't take it anylonger. The prednisone actually worked like a miracle drug. I can actually move around in my house again. I know that I can't take this drug alot but for now| I am grateful that I can move about. I don't like to feel doped up and sleepy so people who take this oxycontin the way we are supposed to are helped but it does not rid the pain. I have no time for people who take the drug for no reason except to get high. These people make a good drug get a bad reputa,OxyContin,55-64,Female

L5 and S1 fused ok but L3 and L4 did not fuse. Many Docs now say that nerves are so jumbled up that they refuse to do any surgery because of probable paralysis. I am on Oxy 40mg three times daily with Percoset 10/650 as breakthrough relief. Have had severe con- stipation all these years until just recently when Doc put me on Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF and one stool softener morning and night.  Praise God for the relief I have.  No more constipation.  Reminds me when I was a kid.  (I am 73 years old) For Cryptobob's post of 6/14 and others with constipation problems| you all have my sympathy. I highly recommend this stuff.  It takes a couple of days for it to work but for me it is GREAT.  As for pain| I can walk or do light physical activity for 10 minutes but then must sit down for 5 minutes before resuming activity.

4623,4639, nic| 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,4,5,3,I was in a car accident at age 7| now 33. I required a spinal fusion in L3-5. The nerve damage caused partial parallysis in legs and complete parallysis in feet. Wheelchair @ first but later started using forearm crutches. The swing-thru way so it caused my hips to dislocate. 13 yrs ago| became pregnant w/ 1st born| high-risk| permanently placed in wheelchair. 2 yrs later| 2nd child came about. Thats when I began pain meds although pain began long before that. I was afraid to get on anything. Vicodin was my first rx meds. Went from that to 60 mg OxyContin/day. Could barely take 1/2 that w/out feeling nauseated. 2 yrs later| 9yrs ago| couldn't seem to get enough. now I'm taking OxyContin 80 mg/3 xs/day + oxycodone 15 mg/3 xs/day + neurontin 600 mg/2 xs/day. The pain relief is extraordinary| but when ocs wear off| pain is 10 xs worse. Withdrawals are horrendous. Slow breathing. I have tried methadone| perks| vicodin| etc.| etc| and I do believe OxyContin is the best for pain relief| if you take it correctly| and never run out. Also| its good to take less on good days and more on bad days| but be sure to even it out. But unless you want to be miserable| DO NOT RUN OUT. Trust me on this one.,OxyContin,25-34,Female

I am 23 and have herniated my back twice and had surgery to remove L4-L5 disc.  My experience is that it works best if you take it as prescribed and after a few weeks it catches up with the pain and begins to prevent much but not all of the pain typically. If not you may need a higher dose but your body will quickly adapt to the new dose and then you can begin to think you again needs a higher dose so use caution and avoid opiod based med. if at all possible.  The shorter you are on it the better you will be. Goodluck,OxyContin,19-24,Male

About anything you can have wrong on a back mine has it. The only problem that I have and most people agree is when they dose a dose every 8 hrs none of these meds even the oxycontin don't stay at a level needed for pain relief for more than 4-5 hrs tops. Then you wait in pain for another 3 hrs then another hr to get it into the system then and it is much harder to get the relief after not having relief for so long it now has to fight your body to control the pain. They don't nessecary need more or bigger doses just dose them at 4 hr intrivals that is about how long any of them last weather they are controlled release or imediate release. ||Good luck to all!,OxyContin,45-54,Male

4755,4771, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,4,4,4,Unfortunately| I was involved in a car accident| which left serious injuries to my neck and back. For over two years| I have been working with doctor AFTER doctor about finding a treatment that was ultimately going to work for me. Finding doctors who are willing to work with me period was a task in itself| I kept hearing about how young I am and I don't need to be taking anything....yadda yadda yadda. I was really on the verge of giving up because my pain was becoming extremely unbearable after receiving epidural steroid injections from this jackass doctor. After getting these injections my back pain did get worse (at times not even being able to get out of bed| feel my legs or feet| walk| sleep| etc.)I tried all different types of medications with no prevail...until a doctor prescribed me this medication. I originally started off with 10mg tablets (1 every 12 hours)| substituting 15mg Oxycodone pills for breakthrough pain| and Soma. That was not really working for me| so the oxycontin was increased to 30mg tablets (1 every 12 hours)| and now I am at 40mg tables| with oxycodone and soma substituting for break through pain-- I am very impressed with how well this medication works (not looking forward to being weened off the medication though)| but it's unfortunate that it IS so hard to get from doctors' these days. I was just lucky enough that I found a good doctor who was more concerned with my health than controversies. The most frustrating part about this whole experience is that I constantly hear from doctor's how young I am| and how I shouldn't be taking anything period--it's extremely frustrating because I don't enjoy being in pain and if I can't be fixed right now then my doctors need to successfully manage my comfort level until a treatment is found.,OxyContin,19-24,Female

4773,4789, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,2,Oxycontin is a miracle drug for most chronic pain sufferers| with a handful who don't tolerate it well| experiencing nausea| sleepiness| and fogginess. Don't take it unless you have  experienced side effects with the smaller versions (percocet| vicodin) because they are very potent. They will save and ruin your life all at the same time. To say they are very addictive is an understatement. Once you take them you can't function without them. Any pain you experienced before is much more intense and withdrawals are an absolute nightmare. Most doctors won't precribe them because of abusers. You will be treated like a drug addict at the mention of pain to medical professionals.  It can take years of suffering for some to get anyone to listen to obtain a medicine like this.  As a chronic pain sufferer due to arthritis| having been through hell and back I have read almost every review with empathy and understanding.

Quitting was much more difficult that I thought it would be even though I took the medication as prescribed.

I do not feel fuzzy in my head. I can function normally and I attribute that to the time=released effect it has. I think it is a drug when used properly is wonderful. I only wish it had less controversy. When I go to get my perscription filled I am treated like a criminal. The way professional people treat me is unacceptable.

I can do things now I wouln't have dreamed before. The REAL Oxycontin is really reliable and I am blessed for being able to use it for my very chronic pain due to a car accident in 1994. The generic form does NOT last as long and I have awakened in the morning in withdrawal! Oxycontin works with my body metabolism; I have found that when I am sleeping it lasts well beyond it's time of  when a new dose is due| allowing me to sleep without being awakened by pain. When I am awake| the normal time schedule must be followed. If I forget to take it on time I feel exhausted and sometimes fall asleep. Recently because of improvment due to chiropractic treatment I have been able to lower my dose from 80mg 3X aday to 40mg 3 times a day. It took me 6 months but I did it! I lowered my dose 5mg a week. This is when I found out that the generic form doesnt work as well| so stay with the real thing if you can! Oxy doen't work on Fibromylagia very well but it does take the edge off in the morning so I can move. Before the DR prescribed it I really didn't want to live because I was so miserable. Only bad thing  is that Qxy is really controlled in VA so I have to pick up the scripts in every month from the DR. This makes it a pain when trying to travel or vacationing|,OxyContin,45-54,Female

With the building boom after 911 I had more work than I could handle. I work alone and to do this type of work alone is almost impossible. Throughout the years of wear and tare of my body| my back shut down. A workmans comp. claim was filed over 2 years ago and I still haven`t had surgery. I recently have seen a Dr. whom I been trying to see for 2 years and was told I need a 9 level fusion. My back is an utter mess. I was put on OXY about 2 years ago| started at 40m 3 x a day that went to 80m 3 x day. It was the only way I could still work. Now my Dr. had his license suspended and I have a new Dr. who has broken me down from 320m/day to 60m/day. Can I tell you how miserable I feel now! The pain is so consuming I can`t think straight. This med is great if you don`t abuse it. Only as directed. I would have the surgery in a moment if the courts would just do their job. But until then it`s living in hell. Over the course of this whole thing approx $80K has come out of my pocket to pay for everything because my health provider won`t cover it all. I`ve lost my house as of the other day and I`m disgusted with this whole bullshit system that they call insurance. Sorry to bore you all. Anyone out there with any advise.

I just got cervical disk fusion and have several lumbar disks that are herniated. I have a sort of mixed review on this medication because it does not take away the pain but does something to my brain that let me tolerate the pain eventhough it is there and I can feel it. I don't want to increase the dosage as I been told that I won't totally get rid of all the pain. This medication has allowed me to get out of bed and function somewhat better but I cannot work on this medication.I am happy that I have a good doctor because the previous doctor to this one would only perscribe me percocet and I was taking 12 of those a day and they only bounced off the pain.I also have experienced the withdrawls which feel like the flu. I would rather be taking the med than not & I won;t go for any of those new meds because they will cause another organ in your body to fail. the only side affect with oxy is possible addiction. I have also tried opana 40 mg but need to take more to get relief but also work well without any funny feelings.

I had already been diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2000. So when I hurt my back  in '03 my body and back just ached. I tried to work until finally in '05 my back just gave out. I was bedridden until my 1st surgery. I thought great| I'll get better & get back to life and my job soon. THAT didn't happen. 6 mths later I was not even able to take care of myself. My legs just cramped so bad that when I tried to walk| I would just pass out. So after having a different surgeon do the 2nd surg. I saw a better difference. But still had alot of pain. Being in the bed for a year or so does terrible things to your body!! I underwent 2 years of therapy. My pain doc tried several different drugs like methadone and muscle relaxers along with a low dose of oxy. Didn't do much & my life was just going by me. I finally found a wonderful doc.HE IS THE BOMB!!He sincerely cares for his patients.He put me on Oxys and roxycontin. I'm on a dosage that has been adjusted to help my high pain level. Without  my meds the pain is about a 9.With meds my pain level is about a 6 or 7| which is very good for me. I'm on some other stuff too| but these 2 meds together r a great combo. It does make me mad when I hear about people   putting labels like ""druggie"" on chronic pain pts. Or people selling their meds| or worse...So| I try not to dwell on those ""looks"" u get or people talking crap| because I know they do. My advice is NEVER tell anyone what meds your on and keep them safe especially on vacation (i.e.Um|clean towels anyone)Need I say more? Or wherever u go. I keep mine locked up. Anyway I really like this medication. I can actually do things with my family now. I hope I've given some good advice to anyone going through this type situation.

I am now back on oxycotin 40mg morning: 20mg lunch and 40mg late in the afternoon.  I really liked the parch but find that this medication works great also.  I hope everone has a doctor that understands pain and is willing to work with them to make your quality of life much better.,OxyContin,35-44,Male

I am now off Oxycontin| have lost 12 pounds quickly| do not sleep my life away| do not need naps| and now have twice as much energy as when I was taking this drug.

4866,4882, jik47| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,4,I have had two levels of my back fused 5 years ago and need to have L1 & L2 fused by doctor told me to hold out as long as possible as I suffer from degenerative disc diasease. Was told by having this surgery now it would lead to having my T sections of my spine fused and my neurosurgeon told me that I do not want to go fusing that area as it is a very severe surgery. Thus I take Oxycontin for chronic pain and it works great for  me. Does not give me the doped up feeling the way Demerol does and I can function normally with no side effects. If you take this drug as directed by your doctor you will not have any problems with this medicine.|The negative of this drug is the people that are abusing it and making it difficult for people that have a medical need for this treatment and that sucks! I was told by my doctor this medicine is for severe back pain    and I do have to admit it works wonderfully for my back pain like no other drug has. But for some reason it does not treat pain in other areas for me other than my spine.|If you suffer with severe back pain I would highly recommend this medicine. I wish anyone with this condition speedy relief as I know how horrible back pain can make life and trying to carry on normally.|,OxyContin,55-64,Male

4874,4890, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,4,3,This drug works very well for arthritic/DDD pain| but there are side effects that can be extreme for some people.|Doctors are very concerned about prescribing it because the US Government prosecutes Doctors when patients abuse it| even if the patients lie to the Doctors - the Prosecutors say the Doctor should have known! (Dr. McIver got 30 years)|If you take it for any length of time there will be withdrawal symptoms if you miss a dose| and over time you will have to take an increasing dose because of tolerance. Doctors want you to take the same dose 2 times a day but I take it 3 times a day (every 8 hours) with last dose of 10mg 3 hours before bedtime so I can sleep 8 hours without withdrawal symptoms. Constipation is a problem| but mental problems will be worse.  After you take it you feel good (enrgetic| happy| stimulated) for the first 4 hours| but then you start feeling really bad - up to a black pit of fear in your stomach and thinking very negative thoughts - thinking about bad things that happened to you over and over| stories in the news will make you feel like crying| people will make you angry and won't understand your outbursts| and you will feel like shit and want to die. But then when you take the next pill you will feel good again. You just have to wait out the low parts and keep thinking that its not real that's the drug making you feel bad. Additionally taking an antidepressant helps some people with the low points| but some of them have side effects - different for each anti-depressant of fatigue or anxiety so you have to keep trying different anti-depressants until you find one that works for you.|Also you might want to hide your medication depending on who has access to your bathroom or wherever you store your pills.,OxyContin,35-44,Male

I was taken oxycontin 320 mg a day and 120 mg of oxycodone ir for about 6 plus years. My cousin stole my oxy while in hospital and reha for knee replcement and due to my family situation my mom kicked her out instead of calling the police. That was a mistake| I went to a few other doctors for pain medicine so I would not detox cold turkey. My doctor found out about it and cut me off except for thr morphine pump| which I would not recomend getting. After he found out about the other doctors he insisted I call the police| and I did even had proof she did it. He still cut me off my meds cold turkey and Ifelt like I was going to die. I now have no dr. because there are only 2 drs in this 200 mile radius who works with morphine pump. My quality of life is now the worst ever in my life| I lost everything including my wife. I am on disability since 1998. My dr. turned out to be 2 faced and I am sol. I sometimes feel like eing it all| plus doing other things that I cant say online. If a family member steals from you turn thm in asap| the doctors have a way of finding out that you received medicine from any doctor. HIPPA is not followed by the law. Don't end up suffering like me. Now I will have to move or go to Canada if possible. I have been in the most pain I have ever been in since my injury and brain sugery| plus knee replacement that mademy knee worse.

4880,4896, Greg E.| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,5,Oxycontin is a great medication for those of us that really need it. I had a double lumbar fusion (L4-S1) and then developed a dysfunctional left SI joint with increased radiculopathy and Sciatica. In other words| I NEED IT! The only thing I can say is to be careful and follow your doctorâs prescription orders to the letter! THIS MEDICATION CAN AND WILL KILL YOU IF YOU ABUSE IT BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU HIGH! I don't know if you have noticed| but there is a growing list of famous people with everything to live for| dropping dead over what they think will be a cheap thrill. For some of us| these drugs are the only choice to make it through life sometimes hour by hour because of the pain we deal with constantly. If you have a valid need for this medication| then hang in there and keep your medication secure. If you are just looking for a thrill| then go someplace else before you end up dead. All you will do is make it more difficult for those of us that genuinely need this medication harder and harder to get. No doctor wants to get blamed for writing a script that might kill a child or even adult. So all I am asking is to look somewhere else for your thrills. I started out this review by stating that Oxycontin is a great medication and I hope that everyone will act responsible so that it will still be there for us as long as we need itâ¦,OxyContin,35-44,Male

I have in some cases had forgotten my medication at home| let's say a day for example and the only problem I had was the fact that my pain would come and not subside until I had gotten to my medication. Although many people become addicted to it I personaly have not shown any sypmtoms of withdrawls when I did not have it. The only problem that would arrise was my chronic disc pain. I believe that this medicine is a god-send and should never be looked at as horrid substance (unless it is being abused by an addict). I would recomend it for people with severe continous pain problems and I have a great respect for the doctors whom believe in the use of it. I had a doctor whom diagnosed me and had perscibed me a medicine that did very little for my pain. When I had gotten a second opinion my new doctor was disgusted with my first doctor's diagnosis and evenchually put me on this medication.

At age 21| I was in a major car accident that almost cost me my right leg. Amazingly enough the Dr.'s ""saved"" it with 4 five inch plates & 18 screws that encircle what's left of my ankle.

I have pain everyday in my back. My one shoulder blade ""pushes"" up against my neck causing unbearable pain| tingling| & numbness in my arm & hand. I also experience pain in the area of my spine that is kyphosis (hump) if I am to active or stand for too long. My leg ""bothers"" me moderately everyday| but when rain is on the way...I feel pressure as if someone is ""tightening up"" the screws. Oxy is amazing. I work a FT job still (somehow)| even though my family thinks I should be on disability. I've never had enough courage to ask my Dr for Oxy....even though it's the best pain medicine in existance. I take it on a regular basis| I'd rather not say how I get it. Vicodin is a great drug as well| but doesn't last for me longer than 2hrs.

I would advise people to be very careful w/these pain meds. Some may say I need rehab...but I don't take meds to ""get high""....I take 'em to function. If my ins was better| I could possibly have a back procedure to help lessen the pain. I am too scared to go thru a 24th spinal surgery as an adult.

I had to sign some sort of paper before leaving the office and then hand-deliver the prescription to my pharmacy. How disappointing it was to find that Tramadol didn't even touch the pain. It seemed to have NO effect whatsoever. The medications prescribed by my dentist - Vicodin and Penicillin VK - did help ease the pain until the infection was cleared up.

The occasional tramadol and daily Celebrex have worked wonders for me at this time. Prior to my cervical fusion 4 years prior I had a Lumbar L4-5 fusion which finally has healed as well. Tramadol may not be for everyone or work on everyone but I've had good results. You have to figure out what least amount of mind alternating drug works for you. If it's truly for pain that a person is taking it for it should bind to the pain receptors and help with the pain. If it's not for pain then it doesn't have a receptor to bind to causing a ""high"". If it doesn't work the receptor in your brain may need a different medication to bind to| to help relieve the pain you are having. Remember there are many different medications for this reason. And always remember it's usually not likely to have ""0-10"" pain rating. Most people have pain and suffering of some sort and everyone reacts to pain differently then the next person.

No head aches or itching thus far taking the Tramadol 50 mg twice daily.   I have heard the withdrawal stories but believe some are more susceptible than others! And everyone is different.  Tramadol is definitely not an immediate substitute for real opiate pain relievers. Doc wanted me off hydrocodone for two weeks before starting tram!adol!   After going off Hrydrocodone I did experience some discomfort for a week.....unexpectedly because I had been on 4 times that amount for four years.... a few years before the ""opiate hysteria era"" started and tapered off without discomfort.   Docs prefer to use Tramadol (schedule III) which can be written with refills vs Hydrocodone even if warranted due to no refill thanks to now being schedule II.   So far Tramadol's only side effect is a little dry mouth and some slight drowsiness!    Pain relief is about 50% of a 5/325 hydrocodone.....but that's better than nothing and good enough for full function.!!",Tarmadol_oral,55-64,Male

Once these kicked in| I noticed significant pain reduction along with euphoria I hadn't experienced in years due to being in pain they didn't upset my stomach| make me nauseous or add an additional headache!

Have been ill with what we thought was a severe concussion from fainting due to being in to much pain and not speaking out about it. After 3 week's of confusion| headache's| and other unusual side affect's my doctor discovered i actually have what they call Serotonin Syndrome because there is an interaction between taking Tramadol and Mirtazapine that i was also taking for my depression.  No-one before now has picked up on this. I'd been taking both together for at least 2 years. So I am now weaning off the Tramadol and have to try a different approach to pain relief as i also need to keep taking the Mirtazapine for my depression. If I didn't need to take the antidepressant then i would stay on the Tramadol for shore because it did work great with the pain. Hope this info help's.,Tarmadol_oral,45-54,Female

5376,5395, Thankful one| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,3,5,2,I have taken this medication for nearly ten years off & on for chronic pain issues related to injuries from a car accident| fibromyalgia| endometriosis etc. Most recently I was on a max dosage of 400mg daily finding myself always waiting & looking forward to my next dose. I ran out of this med on a friday & requested a refill through my doctor's on call service. They refused - I was devastated - had the worst most horrible withdrawal for 4-5 days. I am glad I am off this medication now. I have been trying to use otc meds sparingly along with 1-3 Lyrica daily & cymbalta (have taken both for years as well). I still have mild to severe pain at times - sometimes all throughout the day -  especially at night. The good part - I don't feel the need to take meds every 4-6 hours like I have -daily- for years. I feel pain & sometimes I can even function without meds - it's totally new to me. Don't get me wrong - I have to takes breaks while working. I have to lie down for breaks sometimes. Sometimes pain causes me to walk so slow at work people ask if I am okay - I just try to answer with a positive attitude & gather my strength to keep moving without reaching for meds. I am managing okay.  I could not have said this while on tramadol because I always needed the next dose & an hour after ingestion to feel good enough to get moving & mentally feel better. Do I think I was addicted? YES! Mind you - I never abused the med. I never took against the Rx directions. (I even refused to take the vicodin & percocet I have had in the medicine cabinet because I never wanted to become dependent on them.)  I was mortified when my doctor decided not to refill this med for me - but - I am so grateful for this. THE WITHDRAWAL WAS HORRIBLE. I really wish they would have let me titrate down though. (Perhaps I never would have realized the negative effects this drug had on my life though.) I am glad to be off tramadol & would warn anyone against taking the higher doses of this med regularly. |,Tarmadol_oral,35-44,Female

The doc said it was a mild pain reliever and good for managing long term pain issues. It helped somewhat| enough for me to continue it's use for years but after about 3 years I started to feel unwell. I was getting terrible jitters and having problems sleeping. My heart rate and blood pressure remained normal but inside I felt like I had consumed a dozen double espressos. I couldn't sleep without medication. I thought it was stress related and it took months for me to determine that my body was craving more tramadol. It was as though I walked through a physiological doorway and while the medication helped with the pain in my neck| the amount I was taking daily was not enough to satisfy my physical need for it. I tried to wean myself on my own and the withdrawal was horrendous.I finally broke down and saw my personal physician| not the doc who prescribed the medication and I have been on a several month process of weaning myself. I haven't had any tramadol in several weeks and still feel jittery but I can see the end I think. I am sleeping better but still need medication to do so. The process has been REALLY difficult for me and my family. I'm writing this to warn anyone thinking of using this pain killer to think twice before doing so. If you ask this medical professionals this should not be happening but tramadol acts like an opioid though it isn't technically and it's a bear to stop after long term use.

After 2 wks| shoulder and hip pain are still gone| lower back still hurts and stiff but only a dull ache instead of constant pain and mid back is bothersome. side effects are; constipation| problem urinating (stream not as hard and going more often) and reduced sexual functions (this alone will stop me from taking the meds).  ||I will continue taking for 30 days along with the stretching and then decide if I want to continue taking the meds.

Went to Percocet because Lortab wasn't working as well after 16 years| but I take the smallest dose of both those meds| but I wanted to try Tramadol as it operates the same as the others - but is not a narcotic or a NSAID. The Acetaminophen is hard on Liver and Kidneys (even Stomach)| read the label on it next time your in the store. That was another reason to try Tramadol| but it did not make a normal life possible. I tried it for 3 months| but Percocet dulls the pain to an Arthritis type ""ache"" and stops the sharp pain.

Well maybe..Tramadol has a darker side and creates TERRIBLE withdrawl. DO NOT quit cold turkey and do not take so many that you run out before your refill. I made that mistake. Once your body gets accustomed to being on it you will HAVE to get tapered off. If you take it as prescribed you shouldnt have any major problems. If you end up testing the waters and start taking more than 200mg daily you'll be playing with fire...TRUST ME....Cold Sweats| restless limbs and insomnia| confusion and just lackluster for life and the list goes on..All in all a great medication| just be responsible or else you will have hell to pay.",Tarmadol_oral,25-34,Male

6130,6150, WizeGuy| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,5,4,"IMPORTANT **  What I have finally learned| after 20 years of pain management is that ""less is more"".  I recommend that when you take this drug you take as little as possible.  I take 1/2 pill at a time (25mg).  If you read the reviews here| you will notice that the people that take 1-3 pills a day| but not every day have the best long term results.  You want to avoid tolerance or you will end up in pain and physically addicted.  Giving your body time to dry out in between doses is important| even if it's only 12 hours.  I take 1/2 pill at a time so that my body does not get used to a high dose hit.  I take the other half 1-3 hours later.  If you can supplement your pain management with OTC medication in between the Tramadol when drying out| even better.  If you have chronic pain| less is defiantly more with Tramadol.

6133,6153, aliciatucson| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,5,4,I have Osteoarthritis| bone spurs and cervical disk replacement c4c5.  I started taking this drug about 3 yrs ago and does wonders for my pain and moods. I must admit it bothers me reading all these bad side effects being i take other medications as well but atleast i can work without being dizzy or feeling drugged up on the Tramadol.  Its prescribed to me 50mg 1-2 every 8 hrs but i usualy just take one or two a day and use naproxen with it when needed then alternate with vicodan.  I do this because i dont want to become so addicted to it and have to go thru what some here say they have or are going thru.  All I can say is be careful and watch your body for signs of addiction.  Doctors dont really pay attention to that stuff till its too late and we all have to be responsible for our own bodies and to communicate with or health professionals,Tarmadol_oral,45-54,Female

I liked the energy| but it gave me a feeling of anxiety.  Over time that has disappeared.  I can now use up to 2 1/2 pills at one time.  The tolerance is going up but that is after taking it over a year.  It takes away all headaches and muscle pain from Fibro Myalgia.  I don't care about addiction| I would rather live pain free and enjoy the ""happy"" feeling I get when using it.  Don't drink alcohol at all and the only other meds I have is Firocet and xanax/valium.  Don't need the last two now that I have the Tramadol.  It will work differently with everyone.  For the most part it is a life saver for me.  If I use too much at once I do get over anxious.  So take as prescribed.  I have never had to take more than 2 1/2 per day.  If I decide to stop I will go down gradually.  I do not wish to experience any withdrawals.  I get worse withdrawals from sugar!!!!  Tramadol causes some itchiness but thats about it.

6309,6329, joyjoyjoy| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,5,5,My doctor originally prescribed 100mg/day for fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathy. Over the course of 4 years of treatment| I had gone up to 200mg/day with adequate pain relief. The problem started in April when I asked my doctor to go to 250mg. He agreed| and called it in| but no longer did I have refills. I had to call every 30 days to get a refill approved. The bottle from the pharmacy said 'Please call 72 hours in advance for refill approval' so I did. I got a nasty call from the doctors nurse telling me that if I needed more meds so early| I had to get an appointment and come show the doctor why I needed them so soon. I wasn't out| I had about 5 days worth left| as I didn't always take the full dose. She finally did call the pharmacy and refill it| with strict instructions that I couldn't pick it up until day 30. I decided right then and there to wean myself off. It did take me 3 more months to wean off| but I did it. Haven't had a tramadol since August. I can REALLY tell now how much benefit I was getting from the drug. My moods were better (tramadol acts on serotonin| and thus should never be taken with an SSRI antidepressant) my RLS was very infrequent| I had bounds of energy| even my asthma was better (tramadol can act like a bronchodilator in some people| this is considered a side effect). I even lost 90 pounds over the four years. Now| two months off it| I am exhausted constantly. Nothing seems to help. My RLS is back with a vengeance making it even more difficult to sleep| and I've gained back 10 pounds. Tramadol is an opioid| not a narcotic as some commenters have said. Yes| it has the potential for addiction and abuse| and yes| getting off it after long term use is difficult. Would I go back on it if I had the option? Yes| in a heartbeat.,Tarmadol_oral,35-44,Female

It stops pain| but as another reviewer mentioned- it makes you happy. Its hard to explain but I call them my Happy Pills. This is probably in people who tend to have anxiety| as it lessens anxiety. It also gives you energy initially| and then gives you a good night's sleep as it wears off. Make sure not to take it too close to bedtime- at least 3-4 hours before bed because of the initial subtle energy rush. ||I have heard that Tramadol can be addicting| but as long as you wean off them| as recommended| you'll be OK- take one less pill a day| and your last pill take at about 3PM.

I maxed out at taking 9 (50mg) pills a day| and was obviously very addicted. I experienced horrible withdrawals when I ran out of the meds| and when I finally got off of them. Today I am taking morphine for my pain| which helps| but is not much better when it comes to withdrawal. I am currently weaning off of the morphine and am back on the tramadol to help with the process. So users of this medication beware! It helps with pain but is very addictive. Also| people with a history of seizures should not take this medication. So anyone who has experienced convulsions or fainting...stop taking them right away!,Tarmadol_oral,25-34,Female

6354,6374, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,3,I've been taking Tramadol off and on for about 6 months for a herniated disc and degenerative disc disease.  When pain sets in it works very well.  But the last month or so I've been taking them almost every day anywhere between 3-6 a day for maybe 5 or 6 weeks.  Although I find it very helpful it is very addictive.  I stopped taking it a few days ago and am experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms.  A violent headache| cold sweats| severe mood sings and uncontrollable tremors.  Also the last two nights I could hardly fall asleep at all.  Although while I was using the medication| I would have an occasional convulsion| I did not find that particularly troublesome.  I went to the Dr today and he gave me Fioricet which has helped| but I am still am unable to sleep.  It has been very embarrasing to admit that I guess I am addicted. My advice is PLEASE take the absolute minimum necessary to feel comfortable and try to avoid taking it daily for an extended period of consecutive days so you don't get too used to it.  And when I say extended period I'm talking about a few days not weeks or months.  People are different but for me| it was too late at that point.  I hope this is helpful.,Tarmadol_oral,25-34,Male

I took again after 2 nights later than the first and again had the same symptons. I spoke the 4th day to the pharmcist and was told she never heard of these reactions but recommended a less problematic pain killer called darvaset (got the generic of this) and it was great I only took at night| no reactions at all.

I was being treated with Diclofenac for several years but had to be taken off due to stomach bleeding. The good folks at the VA thought Tramadol would be a better alternative.  This medicine did nothing to help my Arthritis but was fairly effective relieving my back pain but at a cost.  I was in a constant fog while on this medicine and had an extremely hard time concentrating.  Over time I found it harder and harder to sleep and I started to get tremors in my hands and my right arm would twitch uncontrollably.  I knew it was time to get off this. Problem was this was way easier said then done.  I do not have an addictive personality and have never had a problem getting off other so called addictive pain| anxiety| and depression meds before.  This stuff is nasty to get off of.  Tried cold turkey. Bad mistake. Tried skipping every other dose.  Nope not an option.  Had Cold sweats| nausea| shaking| tremors| irritability| ringing in the ears| and diarrhea to name a few withdrawal symptoms.  Had to take full doses during the day and 1/2 dose at night with my Trazadone for a couple of weeks before I could 1/2 my daytime doses.  Even then things were not fun for a little while.

(This was after trying to do so alone many times.)  I had a very high level of discomfort during my drug withdrawal.  There were many nights of little sleep.

Sometimes in the morning it makes me a little sleepy and helps me go back to sleep| but I haven't had any negative side effects. I can take it on an empty stomach with no problem.

6536,6557, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,5,5,I have chronic joint pain due to Systemic Lupus. this medication works fairly well in keeping the pain at a manageable level. The best part for me is the lack of discomfort from digestive side effects such as constipation| nausea| and vomiting which are common with opiate derived pain relievers. This is very important to me since my Lupus also tends to manifest with GI disorders which can be quite awful without any help from drug side effects.  The Tramadol does not add to this. I do wish it lasted longer| however| I'm prescribed to take 100mg/8 hours| but the peak of the effectiveness only lasts for maybe 2 hours.  And I have noticed a marked decrease in my sex drive| but this could be from my Tizanidine or the pain itself. Honestly though| there is no such thing as a completely safe pharmaceutical and I would rather that marijuana was legal for medical use in my state.  I'd rather use a natural fully non-addictive plant that is  non-toxic to all the body's systems when ingested or inhaled through a vaporizer and cannot cause overdose or organ damage of any kind unless it is smoked (and then very rarely).

6569,6590, Tony| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,4,3,I started with 50 to 100mg per day and during 3 years I required increased dosing to be effective and was up to 300mg of ER (extended release). The reduction in perceived pain is dramatically reduced. As I tried to come off this drug I experienced severe withdrawl from dependency. I would characterize it as severe depression| not just anxiety. Nausea| runs| cramping| severe cold sweats| shaking. Long term use seems to also be affecting urine flow and kidney water retention. I am being treated now for the dependency and side effects. So Tramadol is very|very effective when on the drug but not so good trying to come off the medication. Step down slowly as recommended.,Tarmadol_oral,45-54,Male

I have hurt for years| but in the year B4 taking this med| my pain was basically a 10 ... 24/7.  I am 59| have never taken anything except OTC products ... Tramadol has made the pain bearable to almost none. I take 50mg 2x a day (for almost a year) ... and I can function!!

I have had some side effects ... sometimes sleepy| a little 'lazy' (but| I was extremely hyper )... a tiny bit of nausea and some light headedness... I have lost about 15 pounds| but I was about 50lbs overweight ... so| in that respect| I feel better.... BUT| NONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE SEVERE ENOUGH| OR OFTEN ENOUGH TO STOP THIS MEDICATION.  THIS DRUG HAS BEEN A LIFE SAVER ... I HAVE NO PAIN| OR GREATLY REDUCED PAIN| WITHOUT THE NARCOTIC SIDE EFFECTS.  I JUST PRAY I DO NOT HAVE TO GO TO ANYTHING STRONGER.

It is louder than the TV so I have to turn it up.  I have seen 2 ENT doctors who have said there is nothing to help except white noise which hasn't helped.

6681,6703, fat democrat| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,4,4,I use this for herniated discs.  It is not nearly addictive as the hydrocodone or other opiate type drugs.  It also does not have the increased tolerance build up that accompanies those type of drugs.  It doesn't work as well as those in the short term.  If you take one| it is not going to feel better 1 hour later.  I have found if you take them TID and stay on them they work. You don't think they are working as you still have moderate pain.  If you go off of them though| you have more severe pain.  I do not sleep as well on them.  I get up a lot though the night when I am on them.  This may be partially why my back does not hurt so much the next morning--I'm not lying down 8 hours sraight| but instead gettin up 2-3 times a night and stretching it out. They are addictive.  They definitely work on your seratonin.  But| like prozac| the dependance is not going to inhibit your ability to function or live a very productive life.  At first| they give you energy| which makes them appeal to the very ambitious person who has a lot of drive.  I think they  are over looking advantages of this drug to use in lieu of SRIs when zolofts or lexapros don't work on people.  They have been out about as long as those drugs| so we should have seen the long term affects that they have on people.  A psychiatrist would probably say I was out of my mind though.  I don't know.  So| if you have moderate anxiety or depression and back pain that is in the modrate to severe category| this drug| although controversial| may be the answer for you!!!,Tarmadol_oral,35-44,Female

6710,6732, holmar| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,5,3,I have multiple sclerosis.  I used to take narcotics but my doctor didn't like me taking them due to my age so he wanted me to try something else.  I was nervous because I seem to have bad reactions to a lot of medications and really have to stick with the fairly simple ones| not the newer ones.  Anyway| surprisingly| I was able to switch very comfortably from a relatively high dose of vicodin which I tried to stop but went through withdrawals| to the ultram.  Funny thing is| I was able to switch one to the other without any withdrawals.  SO| I am sure it attaches to the same receptors.  Anyway| it still worked just as good for my pain without the warm fuzzy feeling (but that's ok).  Not only that| but I had never been able to take antidepressants and I have always suffered from depression| but I can take the ultram and it has helped SO much.  It gave me pain relief and worked as an antidepressant when I couldn't take the SSRI's.  To me its a miracle drug| except one time when I lost the pills in hawaii.  Not only did I go through narcotic withdrawals| I also went through antidepressant withdrawals| I had aching| restless legs| severe depression| felt like I was crawling out of my skin| sweating and brain zaps|which were like electric jolts going through my head.  In addition| I have to wake up a little earlier then usual and take a tramadol then go back to sleep or I will wake up with withdrawals.  For me it works very well but is extremely addicting.  If I ever ran out| I am sure it would be worse for me then narcotic withdrawals but my doctor doesn't seem to think so| so I will just go with it.  It helps with my pain and depression.

Tramadol is the only prescription pain med I've been prescribed that allows me to have relief from pain| and still be able to function and have a clear mind.  I have suffered the withdrawal symptoms that others described| but the key is to not take this medication on a daily basis. I've found that taking one or two days off every week is very helpful in avoiding any sort of negative withdrawal symptoms. On my ""off"" days I rely on Aleve| which is not enough to rid me of all my pain| but it's worth it knowing I won't suffer from any sort of physical/mental dependence on the tramadol.  Personally| I give tramadol an A for anyone who needs to be alert| yet still needs more pain relief than NSAIDs provide.

My doctor started me out on 150mg a day..I have had to increase this over the past ten months slowly to now 250-300mg a day| other wise I get no relief. You may notice that you become 'hyperactive' depending how much you take at one time. I don't recommend doing that.  I found it works best for me because I spread out my dosage throughout the day taking it morning| noon and in the evening- so I don't wake up in the middle of the night with back pain.  If you are going to stop taking this medication for any reason| do it slowly because you will experience withdrawal symptoms: upset stomach| diarrhea| restless legs| muscle/joint pain| headache| and sleeplessness. It happened to me when I waited too long for a refill.  It is overall a good drug for pain because it is non narcotic-even though it says it can be addictive. Also| another plus is the generic form is not expensive at all. Hope this helps someone out there in pain| I know it can be depressing and horrifying.

I lived with chronic| mind altering pain for years. I have recieved MScontin| OxyContin| Methadone| Dilaudid| Hydrocodone| gabapentin| Lyrica| Elavil| dextromethorphan| etc. This is as adjunctive medication in addition to Mirapex| dextroamphetamine sulphate| benztropine| and a list of dietary supplements. Of those| if suffering as I did| try rhodiola rosea| saffron| L-theanine. They have some efficacy. When a new neurologist suggested tramadol| I complied. The analgesic effects are outstanding for this type of pain| superior to any others I have tried. Years later it still works like the first time! Tramadol has no tolerance building effect| no doped up fogginess| and for me very little serotonergic withdrawal symptoms if I skip a few days. Tramadol does not cause opiod withdrawal. Period. Know the medication that you take and how it works. The slight opiate receptor agonism is so slight that I don't think it plays a significant role in its effectiveness. There is slight mood elevation similiar to a mild MDMA dose. That is all| no opiate-like high. I am so thankful for tramadol. Real pain = real relief.,Tarmadol_oral,35-44,Male

Overall| I have gotten some relief; it does not eliminate the pain but it takes the edge off the pain so that I can function better.

It dulls the pain enough to make it tolerable| but the pain never completely goes away.  That has been fine for me.||The first few days I took it| I did have a little dizziness and some headaches| but they don't happen anymore.  ||I have found that this medication allows me to focus and work without a problem.  In fact| strangely enough| it actually makes me feel less anxious and happier--in a non-narcotic way.  It works like an anti-depressant| for me.  ||However| I do have to take it every 4 to 8  hours| depending on the level of pain.  I suppose it's worth it--I can't take aspirin or ibuprofen.||The downside of this medication is the horrible withdrawal side-effects I have experienced.  I have tried to quit taking this medication several times--just because I thought I might be taking it for too long--but it is next to impossible to reduce the medication and deal with the withdrawal problems when you have other things going on.  I know it will take a huge effort and a lot of time.||Honestly| if I had known how physically addictive it was| I don't know whether I would have started taking it.  As long as I keep some level of the medication in my bloodstream| I'm fine.  But| if I miss a dose or go longer than I should| those withdrawals remind me.  Sometimes I feel like a heroin addict.||It's has been both a blessing and a curse for me.||,Tarmadol_oral,45-54,Female

I was l65 and now am back to my desired weight of 125.  I hope I can stay on this as I asked the doctor to give me the least addicting Rx that will take care of my pain. My doctor did not think it was responsible for my weight loss and I had an endoscopy| colonscopy and a cat scan which were all negative. After talking with others and reading the comments here| I do feel it is the reason for my nausea and loss of weight. I can tolerate the nausea and I am pleased with the weight loss.

I was also intermittently taking Percocet for breakthrough pain at the onset of menstruation and after surgery. However| I chose to discontinue taking Percocet even when offered (as it worked most effectively) because I believed Tramadol was a safer option. I want to make clear that I have never been addicted to anything| in fact| I don't even drink. That being said| Tramadol is highly addictive! While I have never had a euphoric feeling nor have I exhibited drug-seeking behavior; if I had forgotten my script or had neglected to pick it up before the pharmacy closed| horrendous withdrawl would immediately set in. I have done extensive research on opiates and opiate-acting drugs and the literature on Tramadol is extremely misleading. If you are taking this drug for long-term pain relief and hope to eventually stop| please do it slowly or you WILL feel the effects and they are very unpleasant. They are very similar to the withdrawl symptoms of the most highly-addictive opiates; restlessness| anxiety| loss of energy| cold sweats| tremors| diarrhea and so on... Just be careful and know that you are tricking your brain into thinking that you've taken an opiate so when you stop| your brain will crave that ""opiate."" Some have said the Tramadol withdrawl is worse than that of stronger| narcotic pain-relievers because unlike its opiate cousin| it contains an element that elevates your serotonin (hence the ""speedy|"" overly content feeling) which plummets once stopped adding to the already low| uneasy feeling. I hope this will help some of you with your decision to continue Tramadol (10 days or more).

The added mood boost helps a lot also during painful menstruation. It does cause my sleep to be on the light side| never really getting good deep sleep.

Been taking for many years very addictive.  Yes it works great but is it worth problems?  NO!If you're looking into drug before filling your prescription then it's not too late for you to ask dr for something else. I fell into my husband's arms-luckily not the concrete at an amusement park and suffered another seizure and unconciousness.  Ended up in ER again.  That's it.  No more.  Have stopped takind it since last Saturday. Told doctor I can't take it anymore.  The only reason I made it through the week without severe withdrawl is because I had vicodin to take.  Isn't that ironic that the narcotic helped me get off the non-narcotic without withdrawl.  Should be the other way.  Just trust me I've been taking for so long and can take so much thats why I had the seizure. Eventually you'll probably have a reaction- maybe not a seizure| but addiction| withdrawl inevitable. I wish I could go back in time and never start.  I pray I can stay off it this time for good.  I hope this helps someone before this happens to them   Good luck to all.,Tarmadol_oral,35-44,Female

Previously I had been augmenting my arthritis pain regiment with Tramadol 1 or 2 times daily for a couple of years. My neurosurgeon says that Tramadol will not retard bone growth and that the others do so I was taking it exclusively. I ran out recently and was unable to get a refill for 3 days. I can clearly state| I am in withdrawal.  Withdrawal symptoms are headache| anxiety| irritability| sleeplessness| chills and generally a demeanor of perpetual unrest.

7522,7549, DeistRequiem| 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I take this med  for back pain due to scoliosis. It works wonders for me. I can't stand the feeling I get from narcotics. This med actually gives me lots of energy during the day and helps me sleep at night. I also have restless leg syndrome. It takes care of all of it. I have been on it for 4 years now. The only downsides are the crash u get when you wait too long for the next doese  and withdrawals. The withdrawals are bad enough to kill you. I stopped taking it when I got pregnant and had to be hospitalized for a week and be put on IV stadol to get rid of withdrawals. I stopped taking it again when I could no longer afford it  and ended up in the hospital again. I had migraines| severe panic attacks| I lashed out at my kids and actually hated them. I have never been so angry and shaky in my life. It's an absolute nightmare. But as long as you don't stop cold turkey it's great. I still have mood swings when the drug starts to wear off and I still get occasional headaches but nothing near as bad as I had when I wasn't taking it.  I also have depression and bipolar disorder which also adds to the rage and irritability that I have. I can't say whether or not the tramadol makes them worse or better because I do not know. I am not currently on meds for the bipolar and depression so once I start taking meds for that we'll see how it all works. But as far as my pain goes| it is non-existent with tramadol. It works better than narcotics and with less side effects but it is just as addicting.,Tarmadol_oral,25-34,Female

Ultram will help you with chronic pains (stomach cramps| my hip pain from AVN). It helps me eat without worring too much about pain from crohn's flareups.||HOWEVER| this med is just as addicting as other narcotic pain releavers. And i know a lot of you out there are hearing your doc say ""ultram is not as addicting as narcotics| they are better| with less side effects.""||WRONG! I have been on ultram for 7 years. If I don't eat without it| my stomach feels horrible. When you do use it| you might sweat a little or a TON! If I stop taking it| i feel depressed and agrivated. Why is this?||Unlike narcotics| ultram actually effects mood. It has targets for ""happiness recepters"" built right in with the ones for ""pain recepters"". So| if you are no longer taking ultram| your mood changes for the worse. Taking ultram after week or month long breaks| I will feel more energetic and content.||For those of you with severe pain; ultram is not for you. For my surgeries (2 bowl resections| hip replacement| perirectal abcess with fistula) I managed my pain with IV dilaudid at the hospital (which works wonders| yet fades within 2 to 3 hours)| and oxycotin's| more for long term relief. ||DON'T GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ULTRAM AND ANY OTHER TYPE OF PAIN RELIEVER. In the hospital| they gave me IV dilaudid and ultram inbetween shots to help the IV last longer. Durring this time i experienced a seizsure like sensation| shaking uncontrollably in my bed and almost blacking out. At home| I took some oxy's followed by ultram and had simular problems. to be safe| let a few weeks or even a month pass when switching back to ultram from higher pain meds.||ULTRAM IS JUST AS ADDICTIVE AS NARCOTIC PAIN KILLERS| YET WON'T WORK ON SEVERE PAIN.

I have been off of this since Wednesday night and I'm STILL constipated| besides. (Today is Easter Sunday.) It also gave me headaches| migraines; made me very dizzy and very anxious. I'm allergic to codeine and now this. I had to go to the doctor Thursday| too| because it made such a huge lump in my throat that they said to come in-they thought my throat might be closing up on me.I also had trouble sleeping when I didn't take it and very anxious thoughts. I never want to take this again! Luckily| there was another sub to take over me there at the school at the time when I became ill!!!! SOmeone else said this and I will repeat it.

A few months later| I developed pelvic pain again. Waiting for the complete diagnosis for my new pain| my doctor prescribed Ultram (Tramadol) 50mg. I've taken Darvocet before and I was leery of taking this medicine due to the 'sleepy-non-functioning-factor' that I had when taking Darvocet. Needless to say| this drug works well with my body and has taken the 'edge' off the pain. The first few days while starting this medication| I was tired and slept often. After about a week| that cleared up. All-in-all| I am happy with this medication| so far.,Tarmadol_oral,25-34,Female

I was able to titrate down from this narcotic but still needed pain relief when the frame was removed. I'm taking Tramadol and it does take the edge off the pain. It's definitely not for severe pain| but it does an adequate job with moderate pain.

7588,7615, JBK-2000| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,5,5,re's the deal with Tramadol| folks.  It can be a miracle drug for one person and a complete waste of time for another.  Many people report poor results and they blame the drug| when they should be blaming their own body chemistry.  I am in the miracle drug category.  Thanks to Tramadol| I am now able to live pain free (Extremely rare testicular disorder requiring several surgeries).  If you are looking for the euphoria or pain relief recieved from traditional opiate agonists| you're barking up the wrong tree.  That being said| it does provide a mild sense of contentment and serenity(probably due to the fact that you're no longer in pain). Additionally| Tramadol does not impair cognitive functions like their opiate cousins.  For me| the most common side effects include: Mild constipation| sleeplessness| and mild upset stomach.  Never take over 400mg in one 24 hour period!!!!  The risk of seizure or other severe reaction increases immensely when you exceed this dose.  Many of the people on this message board obviously take the drug at incorrect doseages.  If your someone who needs powerful opiates a la oxycodone| this drug will probably be a big letdown.  If you are like me| and prefer the joy that comes with critical thinking (even if a little pain is involved) to the mind-numbing dopiness of traditional opiates| then Tramadol can be a lifesaver.  Good Luck to all!!,Tarmadol_oral,25-34,Male
