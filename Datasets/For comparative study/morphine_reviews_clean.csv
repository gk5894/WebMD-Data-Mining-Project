9,9, NOTaCOOKIEcutterPatient| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,2,5,2,"I have Fibromyalgia| Psoriatic Arthritis| Degenerative Disc Disease| spinal stenosis|spondylosis (sp?)among several other DXs.  Have had 3 lower back surgeries| last one was a discectomy with spinal fusion and a ""cage"" and screws in spine. one cervical discectomy and fusion| I also have SEVERE muscle spasms that are like ROCKS in place of back and neck muscles 24 hrs a day| |I take morphine sulfate 30mg IR every 6 hours.  I WISH I could take ER meds| but they keep me awake for days.  When I first started taking this it worked great| but I also had 10 mg percocet| 4 times daily for breakthrough pain.  My current doc will not give me anything for breakthrough pain as she claims the morphine IS a breakthrough med.  Problem is| when I was in pain mgmt| they had no problem writing 120 morphine QID  and 120 percocet QID for breakthrough.  That worked fantastic and I actually could function in my highly physical workplace.  |When I changed from pain mgmt| to a rheumatologist| she ONLY will write for 90 morphine....so I find myself struggling in my job| struggling with bringing my pain down to a 6 or 7 on the pain scale| when its ALWAYS at 10 plus. I understand that drs are worried about patients selling on the street| but I am TIRED of my doc punishing me foe someone elses problems| dishonesty and mistakes.  Because someone else screwed up| TRUE pain patients are not getting the treatment they deserve and need.  I have 100% complied| in pain mgmt| and also in the pain contract I am required to sign with my rheumatologist.  I wish doctors would realize that there is NO SUCH THING as a cookie cutter patient.",Morphine,45-54,Female
13,13, mtmn| 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,4,4,y worry| like most is the govt getting involved. They think it is too easy to get on the streets. At one time was on hydrocodone| the govt got involved and pain drs afrsaid to write script. So they made it hard to get script but is even more availaible on the strret if could afford it. This is what happens| the only people they stop from getting a med is the ones that really need it.,Morphine,65-74,Male

20,20, South Auzzy| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,rushed ankle in motor vehicle accident = pins and fused ankle joint but feels like a sprained ankle and at its worst sprained but with a hammer wacking it. Deep dull aches and the little tngle which is nothing. Morphine ER really helps at 200mg + daily| dont need anything else bar laxitives and vitamins D and Calcium as opiates will leach minerals. Testosterone fine as very active. My authorizing Doctor retired and am now finding it impossible for anyone to continue| seems odd as it worked for so long with no increase needed| it just works! [For me] - it seems when I see a new pain specialist they are more concerned with chekcing me for needle marks and saying they only authorize small amounts as theres no proof more works and people are dying due to people selling their meds etc... Sorry?... I believe more people die in Australia from sugar related diseases than prescription ER Morphine. Lets get it right and treat people with some dignity - also I am not responsible for what others do so should not have to bear the guilt nor side effects of their actions!,Morphine,45-54,Male
21,21, Standard Aussie| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) ,5,5,5,I take SR Kapanol 100mg BD and find it has the least unwanted side effects and hsa improved my functionality 10fold| also without it I am in so much pain I just want to sit and do nothing. My quality of life is so much better and have taken it at this level with no increase for 15+ years. I have yearly bone density scans and 6 monthly testosterone checks and find keeping active keeps both of these in check. Also I take 90mg Senna extract with the medication to keep my bowels going + fruit and a balanced diet. However = I am now in the position of changing authorising specialist| who is so concerned over people selling the drugs| and despite my experience believes I am having hyperanalgesia that I doubt they'll let me stay on it as hes starting to decrease the dose. Now I am experiencing more pain| to which he says has nothing to do with the medication and is hyperalgesia. It seems my personal experience| regular blood screening and upbeat lively attitude and love of lif e[thanks to the medication] means nothing. Where will this madness end!,Morphine,35-44,Male

It seems to help but the dr didnt like the EKG results. They put me on morphine and I did not like this at all. I started with a severe migraine| dry/cotton mouth| feeling drugged/groggy| couldnt remember conversations I had| was tired all the time| meaning all I wanted to do was sleep.

32,32, pain away| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,4,4,cation is very good when taken as prescribed. Does have all the associated side effects; constipation etc; one large issue is that after several years have been moving up on dosage now on 3 times what I started with. This is a very good companion medicine with naproxen and oxycodone.Have read many comments here- the old adage is true if this makes you dizzy or high then you do not need and should get a different lower dose pain reliver.,Morphine,55-64,Male
33,33, Doctorless| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I was skeptical at first but tried the Morphine SUL 12 tabs. They help me to function on a daily basis. My only downfall is the stigma that comes with the medical profession in Wasilla AK. No doctor wants to see you for general health needs. I was actually denied a visit to a doctor for a physical because I was on pain management. When I mentioned morphine the scheduler freaked out. Hmm I do not get it| other than the Feds or some organization is pushing doctors to get rid of everyone to make sure they get a few abusers. Concerned. So it works| but I cannot get a health practitioner to treat me for annual physicals| etc becuase I am under pain management care.,Morphine,55-64,Female

It was the only way I was able to walk because the pain was soooo BAD. Coupled with norco & motrin| pain level went from 10 to 4. I had back surgery a month ago so the dr is going to try to taper down dosage to 15mg versus 30mg. Hopefully after healing from surgery I will not need it. Overall| it does work wonders!!,Morphine,35-44,Female

The breaking up of discs finally reached my neck and now i have more problems. I can't even explain the level pain i have endured with the nerve being severed to my legs. It took 3 doctors to finally give me some relief by prescribing morphine at max strength.I had even tried oxycontin and it didn't do what morphine does|it works.

45,45, Pain Info| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,4,2,Take this for degenerative disc disease and other chronic pain syndromes- taken along with a break thru medication the combo works well. As Morphine at 10mg has short relief life then use as prescribed oxy codone(percocett)(5/325) as break thru-does work| you do build tolerance and constipation an issue- but every year or so I break off for 60 days to hydrocodone to allow receptors to re acitivate and this seem to do the trick,Morphine,55-64,Male

Pain was not being controlled with oxycodone anymore after 3 1/2 years taking it. Switched to 15mg IR morphine 3x daily for breakthrough pain. Still unsure if it helps like it should.

I can now work and function most of the time pain free.  Now the medical community is becoming fearful of DEA and other authorities who are interfering because of abusers.  If these people are successful in removing these types of drugs I will be on disability.  My doctor is extremely careful as to who gets what and does not need help from these ""authorities"".  For me| this medication is a God send and has not affected me adversely in any way.  My hope is that it can continue until there is a cure for my situation.",Morphine,55-64,Male

In 2008 I had the first of three spinal fusion surgeries and one neurostimulator implant surgery. I live in Georgia where the    government tells the doctor how to dispense medicine.  So my doctor has maxed me out at 160 mg of Morphine per day.  By itself I would have to stay in bed all day in pain.  I have two other powerful pain meds that bring the pain down to a 4 on a 1-10 pain scale.  No one pain medicine helps me.  So I guess morphine helps. It is very cheap.  Also since it is wanted by drug addicts don't tell anyone you're taking it and when talking to the pharmacy talk in a low voice.

I have been taking pain meds for about 10 years now. I make clots|like super in medical journal ones. Started 24 years ago| my body will even make them on coumadin if they dont keep my inr high enough. My body tolerates opiates really well but it also becomes immune to the effects easy. My legs are the sites of my clots| 4dvts in left and 2in right i have also had 2pulmonary embolisms almost died. I am lucky in that my dr is amazing. I was on methadone 120mgs daily but wasn't getting good coverage have tried oxy|percocet didnt do a thing for me. Dr put me on this 90mgs daily and all i can say is WOW im getting coverage like when i first started takeing methadone. Oh and let me tell u bloodclots are more painfull then kidney stones (yes had those too). Only the pain never actually goes away| just dims some. Mine have completly destroyed my circulation in left leg| and nerves are on constant alert sending pain signals to brain 24/7/365. Right leg is less damaged| but still hurts. So far only complaint is upset tummy| but not bad dr gave me prilosec and if im REALLY active not as good relief but you know what| ill take it. I noticed alot of u worry about addiction| but my outlook is| quality of life over quantity and i know physical addiction is gonna happen nothing i can do about that| but i just keep active| keep my loved ones close and involved trusting them to let me know if they see any symptoms of abuseing (i guess im lucky don't seem to have addictive personality).

I don't know what I would do without it. I take the sustained release 60 mg twice a day. If I have break-through pain I take morphine instant release 10 mg.  Thank God my present doctor prescribes them for me. When my previous doctor retired three doctors would not take me as a patient b/c I was on morphine which I had been on for seven years at that time.  It's not perfect but without I suffer a lot more. I don't understand why doctors don't help patients with pain. It is a terrible dilemma  for those suffering.

It seemed like I was constantly taking the pills and they were working for a shorter duration as time went on.Both my doctor and myself were concerned about the acetametifen. I was initially afraid of it. The thought of morphene kind of scared me. I thought it might make me nod off or drool| or in some way make me stupid. None of that was the case at all.I function very well and felt much better with far fewer pills. I've lost over a hundred pounds and stablized my blood sugar and my blood presure| along with a much improved outlook and attitude. The problem I have now is that my doctor fell ill and can no longer practice. I don't know how to find a new doctor who will not think I am a drug seeker if I tell him morphene has worked very well for me and basically given me a new lease on life. I am 57 years old and a couple of years ago I would have thought the same thing. So right now| it's difficult trying to find a new doctor because won't know me. The situation is made much more difficult by the fact that I'm broke and don't have insurance. Morphene is actuallymuch cheaper than most other  medications.

The 30mg dose| 3 times daily| actually reduced the pain rating by 2 or 3 on the hgih end| and with Lortab for breakthrough| we had finally found a drug that| though not perfect| did better than anything else in the formulary.  After a few years| the effectiveness lowered| and the PCP doubled the dose to 60mg x 3| and 4 years later| again I reported overall pain levels increasing| and at that time| one year ago| she raised the dose to 100mg x 3.

I was run over| stomped| and thrown by a Brahma Bull that wandered onto my property.  When I tried to chase him out he turned on me and the rest is history.  5 fractured vertebrate (2 @ C4 & 5) (2 at T12 & L1) and 1 @ L3.  All were Compression fractures.  Now have Spondylitis| severe stenosis @ all sites.  Been through 5 years of being passed around like a football trying to get as much help as possible.  Final opinion: I am doomed to be on narcotic pain relief for the rest of my life.  They are now discussing a morphine pump.  Currently am on Fentanyl patch 50mcg + Flexeril 10mg - Lodine 400mg - Gabapentin 600mg - Citalopram 30mg all 3x per day except for the last.  I think the hardest thing for me to take is the lack the vibrancy that used to be me.  I was a hunter/jumper trainer/rider for 35 years without any mighty injuries then wham - I am an invalid.  I know all the pep talks - I used to be a disabled student instructor.  I'm trying to find value again.  Finding it difficult.

I find it somewhat lacking on the stated release time as 12 hours of noticeable pain relief| I dont sleep well due to pain| so the projected 6-8 hours of sleep a day is far from me. so this would place more awake time on this medication. So 2 tables would normaly cover an 24 hour day? a 24 hour day this medication does not make the estimated pain relief time frame. please note I was misdiagnosed for 5 years| I have had a very very difficult time finding any doctor to help me| I took loritab 10's for 5 years until they had no effect| only after suffering like a dog surgery is now pending do I get a pain medication thats more effective.

312,314, this is an honest review | 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) ,5,5,5,I have had chronic pain since I was 18 years old due to Porphyria (coproporphyria) and have had may visits to the ER because none of my prescribed pain meds. have worked for break-through or severe pain episodes.  My pain doctor has prescribed Vicodin and Norco along with 200 mg Fentynl patches for everyday paid with little or no relief.  So I have been living with pretty severe pain every day.  (I had tried morphine about ten years ago| but at the time I was working full-time and had little children at home - morphine didn't fit my situation at that time.) I recently asked him to change to Morphine last week| and finally he did.  To my great surprise within a few days I was pain free except for break-through pain attacks (for which he has prescribed 1200 mcg Fentanyl Citrate lozenges| aka Actiq).  I am so happy to experience less pain in my day to day living.  It has been such a relief!  To any Porphyria patients| or any chronic pain sufferer| you must take control - don't let your doctors intimidate you - you know your body and your pain better than anyone else.  Make sure you research your pain meds. and make your doctors prescribe the meds. that will help you the most!,Morphine,55-64,Female

I started seeing a pain specialist which has been great.  Morphine helps me| but I still feel some pain| which is good.  I am only 32 and want to have children soon| so tapering has been difficult.

A lot of you are asking for advice as far as your nasal spray. They make an oxycodone NSL if that's the delivery method you need. The best thing is to be open and honest w your Dr. And to find yourself a good one. We may require opioid meds but we still deserve the right treatment plan just like anyone else. For people out there not in the know Methadone is very effective as a pain killer and cheaper retail than most meds w a co-pay. It gets expensive when you truly are in chronic pain.|Happy health! -B.

After the effectiveness of other pain meds (vicodin| percocet| etc.) kept needing increasing amounts of the drug to keep the pain at bay| my pain clinic doctors had me evalutated at a hospital and started me on 60 mg tabs used in conjunction with Fentanyl patches.  After using this combination for a year| I had to drop the Fentanyl patches because I had reached the max allowable payout for this med after 10 months into the year.  My doctor's then decided to put me on morphine 100 mg tabs 3 times a day.  At first I had severe constipation| but never did I feel the brain fog others have warned me about.  I find myself able to use less than 3 tabs a day at times| and I am glad not to have to worry about changing patches every third day because I used to forget and would become ill| not remembering that I had to change a patch to prevent myself from going into detox.  I have been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including Multiple Sclerosis (which causes severe nerve pain in my legs| neck and shoulders| Fibro Myalgia| and have had several injuries to my neck and spine which no neuro-surgeon has ever wanted to touch because of the locations and severity of the problems.

I have 24/7 severe pain.  I get so depressed and withdraw from everyone (mentally) It affects my relationships with family and friends.  I am 28 years old and the only thing keeping me from walking is pain. So wheelchair it is when the pain is overwhelming so much that I beg God to take me ""home"" Recently I found a WONDERFUL Dr.  that has really given me hope.  He really cares and sits and discusses every option with me.  I am on 16 different meds but my pain doc has me on Fentynal 100 mcg/hr change every 36 hours and has just added Morphine Sulfate Instant Release 30mg every 3 hours as needed for break though pain which is a Godsend.  I have been on every pain med in the PDR eg. Dilaidid 4mgX4 OxyContin 160x3 Methadone 20mgX4 MScontin 200x3| etc etc....I am happy with this combo.  I just started Cymbalta 30mg| I also take Neurontin 400mgX3| Soma 350x6| Baclofen pump will be implanted in July|  as oral is ineffective Dilaudid will be mixed with baclofen|  I also take Zoloft 150mg.  Imitrex 100mg as needed| I am also going to be getting a spinal cord stimulator inserted soon.  The key to getting good care is finding a good doctor and research your choice do not just make an appointment with the first one you see in the phone book or the one closest to your home.  Drive the distance because your quality of life hangs in the balance.  I know that it took me many years to finally find a doctor that made me feel like I mattered. I also get epidural blocks but with little relief.  Also take advantage of any psychotherapy that your PAIN doctor may offer to find way to cope with the way your pain has affected you and your loved ones.

I considered back surgery| but I have heard good and bad stories about it.  I have been in chronic pain since 1987| and my tolerance to it is getting worse| and the pain is getting worse.  With modern medicine|isn't there something out there to get to the source of the problem?  All I want to do is walk into the grocery store and be able to walk more than one aisle without hurting.  Depression kicked in many years ago| but I am fighting the fight.  Unfortunately| the pain is winning.  I have done physical therapy| going to the gym|  chiropratics| accupunture| VaxD treatments| fibromyalgia treatments| epiderals| you name it| but needles are not my thing.  Nothing worked.  The morphine takes the edge off the pain| and I force myself to work through my desk job to pay our bills| but fighting pain all day long is a losing battle.  I wanted to give up| and my doctor put me on antidepressant medications.  It helped| but the weight kept piling on.  After years of taking those| I weaned myself off| with my doctor's help| and lost 17 pounds the first month.  I find myself crying| but the extra weight hurt my back more; so| I am going to try fighting without those drugs.  If I need to go back on them| oh well; I guess I'd better| but for now| no antidepressants.  I just keep praying that our good Lord will give someone the knowledge to correct major back problems.||Thank you for listening.,Morphine,55-64,Female

Have been on lortab| methadone and oxy prior to recent change per doctor to morphine. Have only been on morphine for about 3 weeks now. Not quite sure if itis helping pain or not. Lortab did not last very long at all and was not strong enough to resolve pain issue. The problem I was having with methadone and oxy was that both of these put me to sleep at any time.  For example; at dinner| riding in car| etc.  I do not drive auto| thank goodness.  Does or did anyone else have trouble with falling asleep with either methadone or oxy? Both of these really helped with my pain but I was more or less bedridden as I would wake up in morning| take meds and go back to sleep.  Was actually worthless in life.

At 38 I wonder how I am going to make it through another 28 years of working!  I try to be more active| but than I am down for at least 2 days with pain| etc. If I do too much| which moms always do| than the pain is unbearable. I can't even load the dishwasher without being in tears. All I can say is that without this med the pain would be unbearable all the time. I have a great doctor who knows that I am in pain all the time and recognizes the need. I am hopeful to all of you out there still searching that you will give this a chance. My doctor wanted to put me on this med and I refused due to concerns of addiction etc. But keep in mind| the Tylenol in Vicoden and Norco is worse than this medication. For those taking the instant release| try the extended release as it does last longer. Good luck to all of you searching for help and relief! God bless you and our troops!,Morphine,35-44,Female

The Kadian is making me feel like crap do to the side effects i'm having from it. I'm also on Soma 2x day. Kadian is really good for helping my pain for about 8-9 hours but after that i'm in the same boat that i was in before i took it. I have really bad Jaw pain...my Jaw is bone on bone and i'm going to be having total Jaw joint replacement surgery as soon as the joint is done being made.

I'm in pain 24/7|i have a really hard time eating and because of that i have lost so much weight. From reading what other people have wrote that is using this ... I feel a little better that i'm not the only one that has these bad side effects from Kadian. I'm going to call my Doctor in the morning to see what other medication i could try.I'm sure their is something else out there that would not give me these bad feelings. I have had Jaw problems since i was 13 and i'm 24 now. I have had a total of 4 surgerys and i'm hoping this next one will be the last!

If I didn't have a doctor who insisted that I deserve to be able to TRY to live a normal life which means control pain by use of morphine I would be a different person today (not much use to anyone).  I find that the nausea that occurs and the constipation are managable.  I do get a case of the itches once in a while.  Otherwise it is a life saving drug for me!

I never live pain free but having a great doctor who understands and cares is the ticket for getting through the next day. I don't speak openly anymore about the pain. Most of my friends have judged me because of the doses I take and when they complain to me about how much something hurts I just smile and say I'm sorry to here that your not feeling so well.

466,469, KP HATER| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,"I tore my acl and patella back in '04. I was seeing my primary care Dr. (bad healthcare organization) and was very undermedicated. A previous Dr. had me taking a total of 40 mg of percocet a day (oxycodone and tylenol). When I started with KP| the Dr. only gave me 20 mg a day| reluctant like many Dr's to give pain meds. Despite walking around on torn ligaments| because of my age at the time (25)| everyone kept telling me ""I was too young to have so many health issues"". I was then placed on a NINE month wait period for surgery. In the meantime I was reffered to pain management. That was the best thing that happened because of the Dr's knowledge and understanding of chronic pain. Started taking 30 mg morphine er 2x a day. After the 1st surgery| the hospital lost ALL of the film| AND surgical reports. My knee was 10x worse after the botched surgery than before. Now| 3 years and 2 more corrective surgeris later the meds have been upped to 500mg of morphine er and 40mg of percocet a day| and a home electrical stim machine.  The moral of my story is GET A GOOD DOCTOR! Anyone experiencing chronic pain should go to a pain specialist immeadiatly. I tolerate the dose well now that it's been almost 4 yrs. The one thing that bothers me every time I have to get my refills is the STIGMA that these meds carry. No one should feel bad that they have a condition that they have no control over| AND should NEVER have to listen to non educated remarks from pharmacists that have no idea about your condition.
