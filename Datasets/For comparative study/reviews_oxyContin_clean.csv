19,19, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,1,1,1,"I'm a retired nurse of 40 years experience. I have had 19 surgical procedures| including many for cancer. the majority of my surgeries were complicated and intense| considered ""big"". Last week I had a shoulder replacement done at the University of Washington because of intense pain that interfered greatly with my active life. My shoulder was shot and I was bone on bone.|I have never taken oxycontin before. This drug was horrible.  I believe I was only taking 5mg because I had no previous usage of this med. My symptoms immediately were horrendous headache| blurred vision| confusion| rapid heartbeat| sweating| with a hot red face. feeling like I couldn't breath. My vision field was like a tiny box. My abdomen was on fire from the throat down. I was extremely bloated| but with almost every gi drug available this continued to worsen. I did not have any recall of the recovery room| although by husband was with me and stated I was sitting up talking appropriately and seemed to be totally alert. the nurses were giving me pain medicine. Please note I have never had this happen before. Sounds were extremely load and echoeing.  It was like I only had seconds of recall. The noise and lights were horrible. I couldn't stop moving.  I reported this numerous times to the nurses and their solution was more oxycontin and loading me up with stomach meds.|I declined the pain med asking for a different drug| but this is all they could give me. At one point I found myself desparetly trying to get out of my hospital gown and dressing as I said""I need to get the hell out of here| and where am I."" I refused oxycontin. ai was hurting bad. A few hours later the symptoms were subsiding a bit and I was able to logic out that something scarry was happening.",OxyContin,55-64,Female
21,21, f150stx| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,3,3,3,I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and was put on OxyContin due to other Fibromyalgia meds not helping with the chronic pain.  The meds worked great prior to them changing it's formulation.  After the formula was changed its effectiveness went to crap.  I was back to square one.  I see a pain management doctor and he recommended Methadone due to its half life and cost effectiveness.  I did my research and went with my doctor's recommendation even though I was worried about some horror stories I read online.  In the end I'm glad I made the switch.  The monthly cost is SIGNIFICANTLY less ($10-$15 per month) and after taking the medication for 3-4 days I was able to experience its full effectiveness.  I experience less pain and use less breakthrough medication.  OxyContin worked well before the formula was changed| but after the change I felt like its effectiveness was 1/4 of what it used to be.  ||Fibromyalgia patients often get dismissed due to the inability to clearly define the root cause of the pain.  As a result| they are forced to live in pain which significantly reduces their quality of life. Everyone's body| symptoms| and effectiveness of some medications are unique.  I'm lucky and thank God every day that I have a knowledgeable| empathic| and caring pain management doctor who believes / believes in his patients.  ||To everyone experiencing chronic pain ..  I pray / send positive thoughts your way in hopes you find the relief you deserve to not only improve your quality of life but also to enable you to live your life to the fullest instead of just trudging through and merely surviving day by day.||Good luck and Godspeed!,OxyContin,25-34,Male

After sustaining a GSW to my abdomen| losing a portion of my stomach| liver and abdomen wall nothing else worked.Because of all the negative media it has now become difficult to get my insurance company to cover the cost. I would like to change to something else| simply because of the stigma attached.Any suggestions?,OxyContin,55-64,Female
23,23, Chronic | 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,It should be known not all brands of this medication contain the following inactive ingredients: butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). My own personal experience with this hazardous additive (BHT)which is not meant for human consumption was horrific. I am taking a brand of Oxycodone that has no (BHT)filler and within days literally my Gut rott passed along with my migraines. Also another very important point the effectiveness of the medication was greatly increased minus the (BHT). I was able to cut my daily dose down to almost half taking  my brand without (BHT).,OxyContin,45-54,Male
24,24, neverending| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,4,2,I have been using Oxycontin for 7 years for chronic back| and leg pain from an accident 19 years ago. I was on Vicodin off| and on for 12 years until I had surgery on My back 10 years ago| but it did not fix the nerve damage that was already done. Started on 10mg 2x a day| it barely helped| Dr. increased to 20mg 2x a day that helped for about 4 years| then had to increase to 30mg 2x a day. Recently I got used to the 30mg dose| but I could not bring Myself to increase the dose again| so I had My Dr. lower it back to 20mg. Oxycontin works great for chronic pain| except for the long term effects of being highly addictive| loss of effectiveness and side effects of Low-T| and depression. I would not recommend using it unless absolutely no other choice for pain management. It turns into a downward spiral over time.,OxyContin,45-54,Male
25,25, Keith H| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,I am fully satisfied with the performance of this medication. The problem is doctors don't want to prescribe it and pharmacists don't want to fill the prescriptions. How on earth there could be a medication *specifically* made to treat long term| chronic pain and the prescribers and pharmacists are afraid to use it. I think I have tried just about every pain medication there is on the market and nothing works to relieve my pain like OxyContin. I am moving soon and of course will be changing doctors and pharmacies - I just hope I find a sympathetic doctor who's not afraid of the prescribing-police! But the medication itself works wonderfully. I have been pain free and able to return to work because of OxyContin. It's a God send!,OxyContin,45-54,Male
26,26, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,Oxycontin has been a godsend for me. I'm able to do normal| daily things.  However| after two solid years of taking the same amount| I find that its effectiveness has worn off. But I'm afraid to increase my dosage.  One side effect I'm noticing is complacency.  Some days| I feel that I just don't care about anything and will sit around in a daze| and that scares me!,OxyContin,35-44,Female

36,36, Steama| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,3,4,4,I had a 15|000 lb. forklift crashed my right foot almost 9 yrs ago. I have been in constant pain since then. I have been seen by up to a dozen Drs. including the head of the Neurological dept. at Mass. General in Boston. I've done everything that have suggested - nerve blocks| lidocain infusions| P/T and more meds. then I can remember. The only medication that has been of any help - has been the oxycontin. The best were the OC - but now all you can receive is OP. I'm on 60 mg. 3-4 times a day plus 20mg. as needed - probably 2-4 daily with 5mg. oxycodone break through. With the meds. I'm a pain level 4 to 5! I have to live with this - as it's the only relief I can get - I don't want to go any higher as its affects my day to day functions. I should  also say that my final diagnosis was permanent soft tissue damage and permanent nerve and vascular damage. It's not a perfect life - but its better than being at a 7 or 8 pain level all the time.,OxyContin,55-64,Male

I had issues with the medication so my Dr. switched me to Oxycontin 40mg 2x daily with oxycodone 10mg for break thru pain. I've been on this for about 6 months and it has truely worked for me (chronic severe lower back pain) I rarely need the break thru medication as the dosage I'm on seems for the most part to work as intended. No weird feelings| no slow feeling etc. If you take the OxyContin don't miss your doses.

56,56, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,4,3,3,I have chronic pain after a severe deep vein thrombosis and surgery which left my veins damaged and painful. I was put on oxycontin and over a year had my dose adjusted to 2x 60mg per day with 20mg of liquid oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Because I'm on blood thinners| opioid painkillers are the only option for me. This medicine does work to reduce pain| and it is easy to use in the sense that you just take a couple of pills. However| tolerance does build| or at least it did for me| and I had side effects including lethargy and dizziness. I hate the side effects and wanted to come off the medicine and see if I could get by with the pain - I feel as though my pain has become less bad| but am not sure due to the medication. The doctor said I have to come off really really slowly to avoid withdrawals. I have noticed that if I oversleep and therefore miss the usual time I take my morning OC| I feel very awful| it's a feeling I can't really describe| but it's terrible. On the one hand| this medication has enabled me to keep my job and get around for the past year| for which I am grateful| but I am scared about what it might have done to my brain in terms of physical dependence. My GP says it will take several months to wean off it| which is disappointing. I didn't realise beforehand that it could cause such bad withdrawals| I was told if you take it as prescribed you wouldn't get addicted| but they didn't qualify that you could still be physically dependent on the medication in the sense that you go through awful withdrawals without it| even if you aren't mentally addicted. So I wish I had known that before!,OxyContin,25-34,Female

If possible| take a complete meds holiday| during which time (a day| a week) you taper off your dose to a minimal dose or none at all while being closely watched per your pain (under your doctor's guidance). Meaning| do as little as possible to aggravate things... stay in bed and watch comedy movies or whatever while eating ice cream or hot cocoa and cookies. This allows your body to re-set itself so you are less likely to build tolerance. But you may also find the side effects start anew also... |For those who can't get this Rx'd| try Ultram. It is the best pain med for me| I just have to take in small doses so it doesn't wreck my stomach| much like the useless NSAIDS do. |Methadone is a lot better than nothing as well. For guys who refuse it due to how it decreases your libido| ask yourself which is more important| pain relief or having sex. If you choose sex| you don't need these meds anyway... JMHO.|And never| ever abuse or share this med; that's what makes it so hard for those of us with truly intractable pain to get it!||And once again| try Ultram or Methadone if that's the only choice. Ultram is the best pain med I have ever used in my 27 years fighting 24/7 pain. And if your doctor will prescribe methadone or nothing at all| for heaven's sake| take Methadone! The hit it takes on libido will be gone within a week that you stop taking it| so don't let that side effect keep you from pain relief.||And with Oxycodone| as with methadone| watch out for falling asleep.. DO NOT OPERATE MACHINERY| DRIVE| HOLD A BABY| ETC. UNTIL YOU'RE SURE OF HOW THE MED AFFECTS YOU! Fortunately| Ultram has the opposite effect on me; it wakes my otherwise sleepy brain up. Another good reason to try it!|God bless... take care!,OxyContin,45-54,Male

I am currently taking only 2 of the 80mg pills| with no oxycodone 30mg for break-thru pain anymore due to having at least 3 pain doctors getting closed down for giving meds to people who clearly didn't need it.  Those doctors only wanted the money so now I am like so many others who need a pain doctor but cannot find one in the state of Alabama.  I am in desperate need of a doctor to give me the meds I need to deal with this unbearable back pain.  Before this med was originally changed| it worked great! Now it's just a cruel joke with way too many bad side effects.  I have also been to at least 10 other surgeons for help| only to be told they could not help me.  I have done everything they all suggested with no real results.  My only option is to stick with this med as I will not take Methadone or a Fentanyl patch for fear of an overdose.  I will not let my son find me dead due to one of those meds!  I don't know all the details| but I do know people who have died while on those.  I have never abused any medication I have taken and do not drink or use street drugs.  Never failed any drug test.  If anyone knows of a doctor anywhere in Alabama or a state close by that can help me| PLEASE respond to this post.  My family doctor will not keep giving this to me and is only doing so until I can find another doctor.  I have been looking for over a year with no luck.  He knows this as he has to make any referrals to the doctors I HAVE TO FIND ON MY OWN.  They all say they are not taking new patients| do not write these meds| or something else that gets another door slammed in my face.  I have been through all the injections| physical therapy| and many other procedures so please don't suggest those.  Like I said| I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THE DOCTORS AND SURGEONS HAVE SAID TO DO!!

113,113, RodK| 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,4,4,I have suffered from chronic pain most of my life.  It began when I was twenty years old.  Veterans Administration hospital surgeons performed multiple surgeries on my left leg.  The final result was the removal of a four-inch section of my fibula and ever-increasing pain in my left ankle region.  For nearly forty years I treated my pain with aspirin based pain relievers| due to my aversion to narcotics.  In my fifty-ninth year I was diagnosed with a stomach ulcer as a result of prolonged aspirin usage.  I will be on medication for the rest of my life to treat the ulcer.  At this time| my primary care doctor prescribed Vicodin for pain management.  Even though this was not as effective as aspirin| it was decreasing the pain to a level that allows me to live a somewhat normal life.  However| due to the nature of the drug| I was on a roller-coaster| alternating between decreased pain and increased pain as the medication would take effect and decrease in effectiveness between dosages.  At this point| my doctor changed the medication to Oxycontin.  The nature of this drug is to take me to a level of relief for a longer period of time| due to its time-released nature.  It is often referred to as a twelve-hour drug.  This means that it gradually enters the bloodstream and then provides relief over a sustained period of time before decreasing in strength.  This process takes place over a twelve-hour period.  Many believe that the proper dosage is two a day.  However| that only limits the roller-coaster ride to two periods of increased pain a day.  Thus| my doctor prescribes four a day for me.  At this dosage I am able to experience a consistent level of pain relief.,OxyContin,55-64,Male

137,137, BecauseIcare.| 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month,1,1,1,"This drug does have its proper uses. Acute and terminal pain. It has a very high dependency and addiction rate along with a severe psychological dependency. Opiates have been around for thousands of years and when used for the right purposes it works great. The problems that stem from prolonged use can be very detrimental to the user. Opiates attach themselves to several area's of the brain| blocking the body's natural abilities to ""feel""| ""deal"" and ""heal"". There ARE cases whereas long term use is necessary|however| the issue is in most cases it's not. After a few month's of use| you WILL become dependent on this drug physically and emotionally. After that| the user's ability to ""cope"" with everyday issues becomes uncensored if you will. You will begin to lose your identity of the ""self"" and go into mode-operative. You will begin to see serious issues that need your attention become not so important anymore. An "" I DON""T GIVE A CRAP"" ideology if you will| will begin to emerge. In other words| you stop ""feeling"". The drug becomes your everything coping mechanism. There are many other healthy choices to make when dealing with chronic pain issues. And in my opinion| many of today's chronic pain is related or stems from ones lack of ability to process negative EMOTIONS.

I sometimes fell they really don't know themselves and I believe they should not force their beleives on Patients who are in need for something that works for them. I at least am able to walk| move with little pain| able to do some house work. Before taking Oxycontin I was not able to do any of the above. Sometimes I just can't understand where these Doctors are coming from when they don't even know what's wrong with you. They just look at your information and when they see Oxycontin they talk to you as if you are doing something illegal. I'm not even on a large dose compare to what some other Patients are taking. If it improves their quality of life and  they are able to live some what of a normal life without that awful pain than what is so wrong? I know what that pain is like and you cannot do anything when it attacks you and that is what it feels like| something attacking you. You have no control over it| so taking something that makes it go away for awhile I feel is wonderful. Sorry for those who do not agree with me.

229,230, WisconsinMan81| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,4,3,3,I have been on this medication in one form or another for years now. I've learned you have to take the good with the bad| the good being decrease in pain. Here are some of the bad. I have problems concentrating| and speaking clearly at times. I have horrible withdrawal pains in my whole body if I don't take it for a day. It lowers my sex drive| also making it harder to climax. It constipates me| especially if I take all of my doses for the day. (20mg 3 times daily). It can effect my mood| usually being a downer. It seems to make me talk a lot| and sometimes talk about things I normally wouldn't with people. I have had to stop taking it before and the withdrawal symptoms are absolute hell. I had problems with deep depression a month| and the stomach cramps and diarrhea lasted 3 months. If you decide to take this medication| realize the risks and effects it will have on you both physically| and mentally. I am not trying to discourage anyone from taking a medicine if it is needed| but make sure it is needed before you chose to take it. I also want to point out this is a long term drug| and is only supposed to take away 20% of the pain according to the pain clinic I go to.,OxyContin,25-34,Male

317,318, Irish4TheTruth| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,1,1,1,"I shattered my foot about 9 months ago and here's the deal... When i was in the hospital my pain was under control then when i left the hospital and got my meds through out patient pharm. it totally changed. Come to find out the formulations for the oxycontin was different than those from the in patient pharm. So I've done my research and I find it absolutly ridiculous that this drug was taken off the market to be replaced with a possible cancer causing formula that in all honesty doesnt work even half as good... And why was this done? So people wouldnt abuse it anymore? I mean come on people there are so many differnet types of medications that have the same exact affect on these abusers. So the only people who are suffering in my opinion are us who need this drug and not the abusers. Lets be real everyone knows that an addict is going to find a way to get their fix through hell or high water. What i would love to see is for whoever the hell it is who got this banned to wake up and realize that by taking the better and more affective drug off the market is doing nothing to the abusers. NOTHING!! Inconsiderate if you ask me. To put a drug on the market that can cause cancer| but it's okay because they can sleep better at night knowing people aren't getting high on the old formula. Instead years down the road us who need this drug and need to continue to take it will develope cancer while these abusers are still getting high on heroin or some other med. SOOO what do we do? aaahhh! haha I guess nothing but roll over and get cancer shoved straight up our ... IDK just idiotic and stupid. It makes me think that there is some kind of hidden agenda here. I mean really it makes no sense to take it off the market and start dispensing cancer instead. Its obvious that by taking it off the market it will increase heroin sales. So maybe these corps or ""someone who matters"" has their fingeres in the dope game?? IDK.. It's something to think about.",OxyContin,35-44,Male

I was actually able to get around my house and for short distances without the aid of my wheel chair. It made the pain tolerable and I could do things again without being so much pain. However when they changes the formula| the drug did not work as well. It did not have the same effective pain relief. It also caused nausea and several sweating. I truly thought the previous version was a dream come true. I will be going off the current version at the end of the month to a time released morphine. I did not want to do it| but I need to take a medication that is effective. This is not a cheap medication and when you pay over $ 400 per month for it| the medication should work for you.

I had taken only what was prescribed| no more than and some days less so as to not become adicted. I would be riding in a car with husband driving and just 'pass out'.  Doctor increased the amount and that was when the seizures started. No warning. It builds up in your system according to the hospital doctor when I was admitted.

She was 22 years old and a new beride of 4 months. Her husband found her dead in bed. Autopsy showed buildup of oxycontin so great that her body could not be embalm her for burial.  It is a very DANAGEROUS DRUG. My 'new doctor' put me on Oxycodone with no fillers and it works without the problems of Oxycontin. 15 mg of Oxycodone 3x a day works wonders for me.

458,459, drchiptravis| 65-74 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,5,4,5,after reading some of the reviews| I am very different from most of the reviewers| in that i am taking it for pain after a total knee replacement| and therefore have a nebulous future date of no use at all. Unfortunately| this drug is a favorit street drug and thus has a bad rep. It's rep as being addictive causes people like me to restrict our use until the pain gets really bad| when it is best used to keep the pain a level that allows for useful rehab exercises and stretches to be done. Too much pain inhibits the muscles from proper function. For you patients who have conditions that cause pain as a symptome| please try to find an alternative care doctor knowledgeable in chiropractic| acupuncture| nutritional supplements| massage| and exercise (not necessary to be able to do all these| but as a guide to use). If all you are doing for your problem is to take oxy| then you will always be on it. While it is working try a natural approach as an adjunctive. They work well in many cases. I am a chiropractor with the knowledges mentioned above| and until the knee surgery was taking no drugs at all| for anything. Don't give up.,OxyContin,65-74,Male

462,463, thx2u| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Caregiver) ,1,1,1,I am writing this review as a caregiver from a husband about his wife. After living with my wife in chronic pain for the past 8 years she had finally tried Oxycontin OC in Dec. 2009. It was the best medication ever given to her out of the many ones she had tried during her 6 yrs of going to pain management Dr's. It actually gave me my wife back to me. She felt normal again| and was able to go to family functions and do some miner things like housework and cook meals and visit her family all while feeling good| and free from majority of the pain. |These are things that are taken for granted sometimes by people not living with chronic pain. It all went downhill in Sept.2010 when this medication was changed without warning to a new medication called Oxycontin OP. It even has a new look. It had bad side effects for her. Sometimes the medication would not even work and pass right through her. She was prescribed 3 a day and she would start falling asleep and could not move| and having severe headaches| blurred vision and all of this started with the new pill.|It's a shame they could not have come up with a better way to acomplish what they were trying to do with these pills than using this glue. They are obviously not breaking down the same as before. It's also a shame that honest chronic pain people had to pay the price for those that abused medications| and those people will continue to abuse the new pills and any others they can get there hands on.|So we are 1 time to the ER| and 6 visits to Pain management in the 3 months now trying to find another pain medication combination to give her the relief and life back that she deserves. We are very discouraged with the Perdue drug company| and at this point will not take any medication that they manufacture. Shame on you !!,OxyContin,45-54,Male

I did go back to my doctor| (in a major Pain Clinic)| and they swear up and down that they knew nothing about the new ""OP"" meds until they heard about it through the patient complaints. And now the complaints are pouring in. Doc said I was one of the first to report it but now there are multiple pain doctors with multiple patients each that are reporting problems. My doctor increased my Oxycodone I.R. dosage and that has helped with the pain control. But it's nothing close to how the ""OC""'s took care of it. Taking 2 of the 30mg I'R's| the pain returns 2-4 hours later. I try not to take the ""OP""'s because of how they make me feel. Nauseated| feeling ""odd"" is the only way I know how to put it| and then there's the bowel issue. Before| with the ""OC""'s| I was as regular as clockwork. (I take Senna-S daily at a specific time) Now| my bowel habits go from one extreme to the other. That is one issue that affects my life in a big way. And as far as pain control and the ""OP""| I don't get anywhere near the same pain relief as compared to the ""OC""s.

I really appreciate that they are working on trying to make this harder to abuse.  But is sure has affected my ablilty to function.  The makers of Oxycontin (Purdue Pharma) have seen numerous law suits saying that their drug killed someones son or daughter.  The truth is that these people that have died from ABUSING oxy's would have died from abusing something else.  So why in the world should the rest of us that have the unfortunate need to control our pain suffer from the actions of just a few IDIOTS (IE:Junkies| Government| and idiot people)  I suggest complaining to the FDA and to you congressman and senator about it.

I worked with my primary care dr for years to find this life changing drug. i know the abuse factor is relevant to the changes but cant we please find a way to help those who really need this medicine instead of me having to suffer so at the age of 54 when this medicine enhances my pain relief. Please tell me what i can do. i dont want to take more than i do now. i use to take meds for breakthrough pain but stopped that because i didnt want to become dependent on 2 medications although they helped but i didnt want to combine for obvious reasons.

Today| I have major stomach problems and feel like I'm going to throw up.  After taking the pill this morning| it felt like it was stuck in my esophagus| so I ate some food to help get it further down in my stomach.  Then| it felt like there was a brick in my stomach.  Those things are bad enough| but the worst part is that I'm now in lots of PAIN despite taking the extremely expensive medicine.  The newly formatted pills DO NOT work.  I read that it contains some type of polymer that is in plastic and finger nail polish.  Maybe the pills go right through the body without dissolving?  We need the original formula back!  If anyone hears of a class action law suit against the manufacturer| please let me know.  Us Chronic Pain Patients have to stick together.  As for now| Ill have to ask my pain mngt doctor to prescribe something else.",OxyContin,45-54,Male

I believe PURDUE knew what they were doing long before we got the new medicine. They would pay their fine and change the main ingredient of the pill OC and the Gov. wouldn't follow up with the overdosses. Now what do the cronic pain suffers do.

579,580, dagwoodbowser| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,1,2,1,I have been prescribed Oxycontin since 2003. Started at 40MGs twice a day and in the last few years were moved up to 80MGs 2 times a day. The old OC medicine was a real miracle. I am in my 40s and already had a knee joint replacement. My other knee is at a Stage 4 of Osteoarthritis and will also be replaced. With OC I was able to walk and do many activities. A few weeks ago my Prescription was refilled| but I got the new formulation| OP. Within a few days I began to have acute headaches| dizziness and 4th of July bowl explosions of chronic diarrhea! Worse yet| no pain relief what so ever. I went back to my doctor and he said that one of the new ingredients is actually a Laxative? After researching this further I found whats in this new formulation.|(BHT) it is an additive in cosmetics| pharmaceuticals| jet fuels| rubber| petroleum products| electrical transformer oil| and embalming fluid. |  |Polyethylene Oxide. It is the basis of a number of laxatives (e.g.| macrogol-containing products such as Movicol and polyethylene glycol 3350| or SoftLax| MiraLAX or GlycoLax). It is the basis of many skin creams| as cetomacrogol| and sexual lubricants| frequently combined with glycerin. Whole bowel irrigation (polyethylene glycol with added electrolytes) is used for bowel preparation before surgery or colonoscopy |  |Titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen. It is widely used to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints| plastics| papers| inks| foods| and toothpastes. It is also used in cosmetic and skin care products| and it is present in almost every sun block| where it helps protect the skin from ultraviolet light. |  |The reason Purdue changed the name from OC to OP is because it stands for OxyPoison! $1200 is not worth it and I will Never take it again.,OxyContin,45-54,Male

I went through so much constant| uncontrolled pain before the doctor prescribed the OxyContin. I was so grateful and I felt I was finally in contol of my pain| instead of the other way around. When I filled my prescription about two weeks ago| I noticed the physical difference in the meds. But I immediately saw that it was not a generic brand and that Purdue was still making them| and I went on home. (pharmacist confirmed that as well) I didn't notice a major difference until about 18-24 hours after I started taking these ""OP""-types. I started getting muscle cramps| charlie-horses| muscle spasms| whatever you want to call them| all over. My hands| feet| legs and inner thighs| (VERY painful)| started spasming. And the sweating started. Hot| cold| hot. I'm not in contol of my pain now. After 3 days I was miserable and called my doctor. They said they hadn't gotten any negative feedback and didn't know why I was having these problems.  I called Purdue and filed a report and also talked to their ""Medical Inquiries"" Dept. They| (3 different people) at Purdue said they hadn't received any other negative feedback and said they din't know why I was having these issues| but that they would ""file the report"". These calls to Purdue were on the 24th and 28th of Sept| 2010. I have since insisted on making an appt. with my doctor to figure this out. But now| I get on WebMD and see all these reports and comments about similar problems and it's ""news"" to the doctors' and Purdue? Folks| I take mine as prescribed. I don't smoke| at all. I don't drink| at all. And I sure don't do any of those street drugs. All I asked for was pain control. I didn't think I had to ask for honesty with that order of pain control.

As a patient and if you find that this new version of the Oxycontin doesn't work as well as they did before you should contact the FDA and voice your opinion that this new product is not as effective as the old ones. The number for the FDA is 1-800-332-1088. They don't even know what the long term effects that this new formula will have on individuals. But if the FDA can't even have a recall on our eggs for two years how can they give the ok on this medicine. So if this medicine is not working as before make the call.",OxyContin,45-54,Female
612,613, [email protected]| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,1,3,1,I have been on this medicine since 2002 due to major back issues. I have had 2 surgeries with no success. The new formula gives me severe headaches and nausea. I have been bed ridden since i started taking them.  I have spoken to the pharmicist and she said that all pharmacies will be going to these pills. I think i would prefer going on morphine and oxycontin together to kill the pain.,OxyContin,35-44,Female
613,614, noblegases| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,2,3,1,The newly reformulated OxyContin is a nightmare. It is not controlling my pain. I have nausea| fevers and constipation. I am probably with drawing. I have stage 4 breast cancer with mets to liver and bone. I have bone and liver pain. I had a much higher quality of life. I was able to bicycle a mile a day and exercise. I am now more bedridden and do not travel as far away from my home. This is a toxic drug. I feel like it has the narcotic equivalent of Antabus in it. I literally have an aversion to taking it.It is also using liver pathways that it previously did not. Oxycontin was used with patients that have liver metastatis to aviod burden to the liver. Now the drug is using pathways my chemotherapy uses. I hope it is not reducing my chemos affect.  It is also rendering my break through pain meds ineffective.,OxyContin,45-54,Female

I will have to go back to finding something that works as well| The fear here is that if you complain about the new ones everyone is going to assume you just want the old one's back to abuse ! not true I never took them anyway but by mouth and for the one person who said they work fine for them and that the rest of us aren't fooling anyone SHAME ON YOU! there might be some false people writing here but i don't believe all these statements are false .

BUTT now with the OP pill it is worst than any generic brand| and also it has caused my stomach to stop up like b-4 when PURDUE  wanted to save money and make a sub-standard pill and like then my $ amount didn't go down when the quality went down. Keep the same med. like b-4 and drug test the ones you think are selling or snorting the d pill.

622,623, OPnogood4me | 35-44 Female  (Patient) ,1,1,1,I started on the new OP/40mgs 3 a day on 9/6. I didn't notice that it wasn't working as well but by 9/14 became violently ill to my stomach after days of constipation which was controlled on the old formula as I was on the same dose for 9 of over 11yrs. Since 9/14 I haven't been able to take more than 2 a day and can't even take my Percocet for breakthrough pain as prescribed. 9/14 started vomiting| the next day woke up to feel flu like symptoms w/ a fever| still having stomach problems as today is day 18. I just called my doctor and will call/email Purdue and the FDA. I was amazed to read on here that Purdue actually told someone it was only trialed on 133 patients on 20mgs only? OMG| I've had RSD for over 11yrs and am severely allergic to all other long acting opiates that have ever been prescribed to me. I couldn't immediately tell until a few days into it that I am going through withdrawals causing the flu like symptoms and also having extreme dizziness. I hoped this new OP would keep the abusers away while protecting our medication but if this doesn't change| there is no way many of us will be able to keep taking this and I also pay full price; $570 a month in the donut/gap of Medicare Part D 8mos of the year. I wanted to report my own problems as too many of true CP patients are experiencing this. My stomach is way too sensitive to take what I am supposed to after only 5 days of it. I have thought that we could possibly be withdrawing from the old compounds of OC's as they have to be different in the OP version. I can't take it anymore; going to my doctor today.,OxyContin,35-44,Female

I was totally non functioning.  I have been a chronic pain person for a long tome and have been using the old formula oxycotin for almost two years and it gave me great relief and I was able to function. again I will have to find another alternative unless they make available the old formula to those of us that rely on its positive benefit.  When I called the company and talked to the on line nurse to take my complaints she said that the new process began in April and was put out for distribution on Aug 9| 2010 and that a double blind study was done of only 133 patients for two weeks and that was for oxycotin 20mg only.  A big problem is that the new ingredients or aditives are different for each increase in dosage so the  formula is to my understanding different for 10mg as it is for 20mg and so on. the study is inconclusive at best and basicaly will affect many of us in many different ways as far as positive pain management is concerned. I feel that prude  has not taken into consideration the negative impact of changing the formula on those of us that depend highly on oxycotin for legitmate pain relief. I plan to contact the company again tomorrow during normal business hours and file a formal compliant with the FDA and may even contact an attorney because of the hardship of not being pain free will create for me| my family and those around me as I struggle to manage my pain.

I have taken all kinds of pain medication through pain clinic and decided to give the Oxycontin a try a year ago. It had given me back the quality of life I had not had in many yrs. I had no idea the medication was going to change. I opened my last px| to see a different pill| and thought oh well they just repacked the coating. Not true| Something has changed. I take 3| 60mg a day with Hydrocodone for break thru pian. I was back to pain during the first pill. I'm back to massaging and aching and using the heating pad| can't sleep thru the night waking with pains. This is the 5th day of taking the new pill and I called the Phamacist to see if It was just me having complaints| as I did not know they were making changes. They assured me that many people are complaining of this new drug not working the same. I am tryly disturbed by this and I will make that phone call to the FDA that another poster left.

689,690, DC| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) ,4,5,3,I always say if I did not have pain I would know that I had died and gone to heaven.  I have been on Morphine| Methadone| Fentanyl for over the last 15 years spinal injures resulting in chronic pain with acute episodes. I have found that Medical Marijuana(prescribed) has been the most effective relief thus far| and the safest for my body long range| but the side effects leave me somewhat insecure with the fear of being immobilized if a situation arises where I need to be able to function at my optimum.  The Oxycontin has been helpful in suppressing some of the pain where I can function with a clear ahead.  My only concern is how long it will take until my tolerances rise and a stronger dose is called upon. Example| with the Morphine| I was up to 1000 mg a day before I switched to another pain management drug.  For right now| the Oxycontin is doing what it is supposed to do for the most part.  Any relief where I can think about tomorrow and what I can do is a gift.  So| so far| fingers crossed and optimistic for today.  It could always be worse| so I try to count my blessings.

But my husband seems to think that I'm actually doing much better than when I was on the morphine medication. He says that I act alot better and I'm more like my old self| so I believe I will remain on this regimen. The side effects are: constipation| sometimes they keep me awake| and itching but the 80 mgs didn't make me itch at all| but the 40 mgs do. This regimen is working much better for me| I actually feel much better than what I was on before|and I am more active than before|by far. 7-6-2010,OxyContin,45-54,Female

753,754, finallysober| 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,1,5,1,I started taking oxycontin 20mg 5 years ago for sciatica. At first it was great to have the pain relief| but after about the first year I needed to increase dosage due to withdrawal symptoms between doses. This is when my life went downhill. I was on 80mg twice a day and that script would only last me about 10 days due to abuse of it. I was so addicted that I was spending thousands of dollars a month getting it on the street. The ironic thing is that it made my back pain worse at this point due to constipation pressure in the lower back area. I nearly lost everything in my life that matters to me. The constant withdrawals kept me in bed for days at a time| only to spend more money to ease the w/d symptoms. It is the most addictive drug on the planet. I think that if you have common pain like most people| this is the worst drug you can get on. It will ruin your life trust me. The people who say it is good for them are addicts and they dont even know it. Unless you have a terminal disease or one that causes pain on a 10 scale| DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG. You will lose everything in your life and become a junkie. I am now on suboxone (Thank god) and have a normal life again. Again| this drug is not for you people that whine about a little back pain.

I also have been taking 10mgs of Valium 4x daily for many years and it enhances any pain meds I take. At my last visit just a week ago she added 8mg of Hydromorphone for breakthrough. So you can see I take a large amount of powerful meds. It didn't seem that I was developing a tolerance to the Oxycontin but my pain seemed to be getting worse by the month. Oxycontin is a very effective drug when taken as prescribed. It may take your Doc a few visits to titrate your dosage but hang in there-it's worth it.

787,788, Greg E.| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,"I have posted a few opinions on this subject and I consider this to be the most important post yet! |I have been taking 160mg of Oxycontin 4 times a day. After 2 years at this level| I still get great pain relief and I have absolutely NO side effects. The key here is to NEVER EVER deviate from your doctors script. These doses are timed to give max relief throughout the day and night. I hear stories about people that tell me it doesn't work anymore only to find out that they are taking more than they should and running out of the medication sometimes several days before Federal law will allow a new script to be refilled. This is a very dangerous and just plain stupid thing to do! Once again| you abuse a very helpful drug and make it look like everyone that uses this medication is doing the same thing. Doctors are facing more and more pressure every month to get their patients off this medication and substitute it for something cheaper. Do not abuse the trust of your doctor and especially those of us that depend upon this medication to lead a somewhat normal life. Your actions put your life in danger. One of the side effects from rapid decrease in dosage is DEATH! ||I beg all of those who use this medication for severe chronic pain to please continue to follow the rules set forth between you and your doctor so those of us that need this medication can continue to receive it. With the new healthcare bill| I am scared to death that we will be on the chopping block first due to the cost of pain management. I pray that I am wrong| but has this so called ""President"" done anything logical lately? Please hang in there and follow the directions so we can remain as pain free as possible and enjoy our lives to the fullest!||God Bless you all!|",OxyContin,35-44,Male

The Oxicodone gave me good pain relief| so I could somewhat go on with daily activities. I did require a 3 months to ween myself off after my surgury.Overall even though I developed a dependency| I did get good pain control.

He was perscribed oxycontin for a severe back injury.  After three surgeries| doctors said they would not advise surgery again unless he was crippled. After 10+ years on this drug he was addicted and needed more and more to combat the pain.  Needless to say| Oxycontin finally took his life when his breathing became so shallow and finally his heart stopped.  Although he had detoxed and had been off the drug for almost a year| the autopsy showed severe damage his liver and kidneys which they suspect was caused from this drug. I know people suffer from many severe pain issues as I have seen this first hand.  However| I think doctors need to be more stringent in their approach to increasing dosage| patient monitoring and patients need to be made aware of the long term effects.,OxyContin,45-54,Female

Addiction involves the progression of acute drug use to the development of drug-seeking behavior| and the decreased| slowed ability to respond to naturally rewarding stimuli.

I went down hill after that. They said there is nothing they can do for me. Not even the new disc. I went to NYC and talked with the doc that brought it over from Europe! Frank P. Cammisa MD. Anyway| I use the Oxy from my pain doc. I started out small and didn't want to take it after hearing the bad things about it. But I see it is the addicts that make it bad for real pain suffer's. I am on a mail program where they send it to you every 90 days. They make you wait 3 to 5 days before you get your 90 day supply in the mail and I run out after 90 days and I think I go into withdrawal. Is anyone having that same problem with the mail order? My insurance makes me deal with them. If I go to a local drug store like CVS etc they want $4|000.00 and the mail order is $65.00. Is thius a racket or what?It sure seems thatway to me. My doc gave me break through pain medication but it just isn't the same. He said it would keep me from going into withdrawal. I do not know but I sure feel awful. My life stops again cold in the tracks when I run out and have to wait 92 to 95 days for my new RX. We really haven't found the break through medication that works for me yet. I have been taking this med for 7 years and I wouldn't have a life if it wasn't for it. I so wished they would follow me around with a camera for 90 days and put it on TV and really show how a person in chronic pain life is. I wish this on no one. It kinda sucks for me that this drug rules my life though. I hate that part. I have to plan around my medication. Sometimes I miss doing things with friends and family because I just cannot do it without my med. I guess it is a catch 22 but I choose it.

Make sure you are on the brand name| NOT the generic!!!

It's deadly to your liver to take even 1-2 days too much tylenol| and don't even THINK of having even a drop of wine| beer or other| you'll possibly go into liver failure.|If your doc doesn't agree| then educate yourself-try Consumers Reports mag. or website on ""over the counter drugs"".

1002,1004, CancerSurvivor| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) ,5,4,4,I survived 18 months of chemotherapy for cancer| which left me in chronic pain which one or two doctors finally called fibromyalgia| but which I doubt.  Failed lumbar disc removal from 1980. Fibromyalgia.  Two ankle breakages.  15 months ago I suffered the worst: anterior intervetrabal lumbar surgery & fusions. That means incision in front (anterior) & back (posterior).  Finally| I'm taking now only 10 mg daily of oxycontin| with a little Percocet to boost.  Oxy is the most effect pain killed I've had in over 30 years| although I'm afraid of becoming psychologically addicted to it.  Obviously| I'm physically addicted as I've tried to quit about 4 times in the past 12 months.  Am down from 40 mg. to 10 mg.  I hate to think I'll have to take Oxy the rest of my life| but it's the most effective help I've had in 30 years.|It makes me angry that some pain drs demand urine tests as if pain-sufferers are criminals.  In England codeine is available at the pharmacy store.  Why here are we treated like children?,OxyContin,55-64,Female

It took 2 and a half years of my doctors trying different pain medications before a new doctor put me on Oxycontin. My pain level was a easy 8/10 on a different pain meds. I was on a 40 mg extended realese tab twice daily. within 3 days my pain was a comfortable 4.5 to 6 out of 10. This medication allowed me to do the brutal rehab work that I needed to ever walk again.

I also have degenerative ostoearthritis of T11|12 and fibromyalgia. Oxycontin has been a lifesaver| it does not eliminate the pain but it is less intense so I can at least get out of bed and move around a lot better. My Dr. does not think that it should be working for me any more since I have been on it for 4 years but she is wrong| I would not be able to function without it. Yes it is an addiction but the pain is extreme when I try to go without it. It has been a lifesaver along with my every 3 month injections into my back. I often times feel that I need to take it more than twice a day but the Dr. says no. I wish that the doctors could experience what it is like before they make a judgement. All in all I am a grat fan of the relief that I get from oxycontin| my pain level goes from an 8 or 9 to a 4 to 6.,OxyContin,55-64,Female

1019,1021, PrissyLady| 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,his drug has gotten a bad name b/c of people who abuse it and have no real reason for taking it. For people who use oxycontin the way it is prescribed| it helps better than any other pain medicine that I have taken over the years. After my spine surgery in 2004 I thought I would be OK and able to stop taking it. Sometime 5-6 months after my surgery| I started having pain again in my low back. I have numerous herniations| degenerated spine| spinal stenosis|bilaterial facet joint arthropathy & bone spurs. My arthritis Dr believes scar tissue from my spine surgery is playing havoc with my body. I agree. I go to the supermarket and church and that's about it. In 2005| I weaned off and down to 10mg but the pain progressiverly got worse and I had to gradually go back up.I am taking 40mg AM & PM. When I awake in the AM and the meds are past due| I am almost paralyzed and can't make it downstairs until after the meds go thru my body. After taking my I usually go back to sleep and can move about in an hour or two after taking the meds. I bring applesauce upstairs at night to take my medicine when I awake b/c it is too hard to walk downstairs in the morning to get something on my stomach. There is so many days that my pain level is so high that I can't do anything but stay in the bed. Imagine this strong drug and when my pain is severe that the medication doesn't take it away. People don't understand when you have multiple problems in my T & L Spine. I recently went on Prednisone for 5 days b/c I couldn't take it anylonger. The prednisone actually worked like a miracle drug. I can actually move around in my house again. I know that I can't take this drug alot but for now| I am grateful that I can move about. I don't like to feel doped up and sleepy so people who take this oxycontin the way we are supposed to are helped but it does not rid the pain. I have no time for people who take the drug for no reason except to get high. These people make a good drug get a bad reputa,OxyContin,55-64,Female

L5 and S1 fused ok but L3 and L4 did not fuse. Many Docs now say that nerves are so jumbled up that they refuse to do any surgery because of probable paralysis. I am on Oxy 40mg three times daily with Percoset 10/650 as breakthrough relief. Have had severe con- stipation all these years until just recently when Doc put me on Polyethylene Glycol 3350 NF and one stool softener morning and night.  Praise God for the relief I have.  No more constipation.  Reminds me when I was a kid.  (I am 73 years old) For Cryptobob's post of 6/14 and others with constipation problems| you all have my sympathy. I highly recommend this stuff.  It takes a couple of days for it to work but for me it is GREAT.  As for pain| I can walk or do light physical activity for 10 minutes but then must sit down for 5 minutes before resuming activity.

Please people| be careful and also keep them in a safe place where no one can get to them. Tell no one you can't trust 100% you take these as my doctor informed me he has patients whose houses were broken into because others knew he had the drugs inside.

I am 23 and have herniated my back twice and had surgery to remove L4-L5 disc.  My experience is that it works best if you take it as prescribed and after a few weeks it catches up with the pain and begins to prevent much but not all of the pain typically. If not you may need a higher dose but your body will quickly adapt to the new dose and then you can begin to think you again needs a higher dose so use caution and avoid opiod based med. if at all possible.

About anything you can have wrong on a back mine has it. The only problem that I have and most people agree is when they dose a dose every 8 hrs none of these meds even the oxycontin don't stay at a level needed for pain relief for more than 4-5 hrs tops. Then you wait in pain for another 3 hrs then another hr to get it into the system then and it is much harder to get the relief after not having relief for so long it now has to fight your body to control the pain. They don't nessecary need more or bigger doses just dose them at 4 hr intrivals that is about how long any of them last weather they are controlled release or imediate release. ||Good luck to all!,OxyContin,45-54,Male

Finding doctors who are willing to work with me period was a task in itself| I kept hearing about how young I am and I don't need to be taking anything....yadda yadda yadda. I was really on the verge of giving up because my pain was becoming extremely unbearable after receiving epidural steroid injections from this jackass doctor. After getting these injections my back pain did get worse (at times not even being able to get out of bed| feel my legs or feet| walk| sleep| etc.)I tried all different types of medications with no prevail...until a doctor prescribed me this medication. I originally started off with 10mg tablets (1 every 12 hours)| substituting 15mg Oxycodone pills for breakthrough pain| and Soma. That was not really working for me| so the oxycontin was increased to 30mg tablets (1 every 12 hours)| and now I am at 40mg tables| with oxycodone and soma substituting for break through pain-- I am very impressed with how well this medication works (not looking forward to being weened off the medication though)| but it's unfortunate that it IS so hard to get from doctors' these days. I was just lucky enough that I found a good doctor who was more concerned with my health than controversies. The most frustrating part about this whole experience is that I constantly hear from doctor's how young I am| and how I shouldn't be taking anything period--it's extremely frustrating because I don't enjoy being in pain and if I can't be fixed right now then my doctors need to successfully manage my comfort level until a treatment is found.,OxyContin,19-24,Female

1208,1211, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,5,5,2,Oxycontin is a miracle drug for most chronic pain sufferers| with a handful who don't tolerate it well| experiencing nausea| sleepiness| and fogginess. Don't take it unless you have  experienced side effects with the smaller versions (percocet| vicodin) because they are very potent. They will save and ruin your life all at the same time. To say they are very addictive is an understatement. Once you take them you can't function without them. Any pain you experienced before is much more intense and withdrawals are an absolute nightmare. Most doctors won't precribe them because of abusers. You will be treated like a drug addict at the mention of pain to medical professionals.  It can take years of suffering for some to get anyone to listen to obtain a medicine like this.  As a chronic pain sufferer due to arthritis| having been through hell and back I have read almost every review with empathy and understanding. I may sound slightly dramatic but it really is a tough road for most that can have a profound impact on your entire lives. Good luck to all.,OxyContin,35-44,Female

My back & legs have horrific uncontrollable pain on a daily basis.||I didn't think this drug was working until I was without it for 5 straight days as my doctor was on vacation and his sub refused to fill my script early. (They didn't care  I just had surgery and ran out of all my pain meds early).||Within 2 days without the Oxycontin| I cried and screamed in agony for three straight days. The vicodin I did get refilled did not touch the underlying pain. I did not sleep| I could not sit comfortably| I could not function. ||It was the worst three days of my life without the Oxycontin.||The drug does work. It does control the chronic pain. I wish my doctor would increase the dosage slightly but I am getting grief from him because he is ""uncomforable"" prescribing all the meds I currently have to take just to be functional during the day.||I hate having to explain myself. I hate having to justify WHY I need the medications I HAVE to take. I hate urgent care or other doctors who don't know my medical problems making me feel like I'm a drug addict because they see I take OXYCONTIN.||The medication WORKS. I take it as prescribed. I don't crush it| snort it| inject it or any misuse like that. The stigma this drug and others like it have are unfair and immediately place the user into that ""negative category"".||If you have daily severe ongoing neurologic pain| give this one a try.

My point is that this drug is the only one that has ever really helped me| Percocet and Vicoden they did nothing| I only take the perocet nowe for breakthrough pain| and I'm not even sure if it does anything. I used to take 12 yes 12 Perocet or Viocden at one time| and it did not help| all I did was get sleepy or sick. Thankfully I found the OxyContin 80mg.  It helps a lot but is also very addictive.

1262,1265, My_time_off| 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years,5,5,5,I have been on Oxycontin for over 7 years. It has changed my life! I can do things now I wouln't have dreamed before. The REAL Oxycontin is really reliable and I am blessed for being able to use it for my very chronic pain due to a car accident in 1994. The generic form does NOT last as long and I have awakened in the morning in withdrawal! Oxycontin works with my body metabolism; I have found that when I am sleeping it lasts well beyond it's time of  when a new dose is due| allowing me to sleep without being awakened by pain. When I am awake| the normal time schedule must be followed. If I forget to take it on time I feel exhausted and sometimes fall asleep. Recently because of improvment due to chiropractic treatment I have been able to lower my dose from 80mg 3X aday to 40mg 3 times a day. It took me 6 months but I did it! I lowered my dose 5mg a week. This is when I found out that the generic form doesnt work as well| so stay with the real thing if you can! Oxy doen't work on Fibromylagia very well but it does take the edge off in the morning so I can move. Before the DR prescribed it I really didn't want to live because I was so miserable. Only bad thing  is that Qxy is really controlled in VA so I have to pick up the scripts in every month from the DR. This makes it a pain when trying to travel or vacationing|,OxyContin,45-54,Female

With the building boom after 911 I had more work than I could handle. I work alone and to do this type of work alone is almost impossible. Throughout the years of wear and tare of my body| my back shut down. A workmans comp. claim was filed over 2 years ago and I still haven`t had surgery. I recently have seen a Dr. whom I been trying to see for 2 years and was told I need a 9 level fusion. My back is an utter mess. I was put on OXY about 2 years ago| started at 40m 3 x a day that went to 80m 3 x day. It was the only way I could still work. Now my Dr. had his license suspended and I have a new Dr. who has broken me down from 320m/day to 60m/day. Can I tell you how miserable I feel now! The pain is so consuming I can`t think straight. This med is great if you don`t abuse it. Only as directed. I would have the surgery in a moment if the courts would just do their job. But until then it`s living in hell. Over the course of this whole thing approx $80K has come out of my pocket to pay for everything because my health provider won`t cover it all. I`ve lost my house as of the other day and I`m disgusted with this whole bullshit system that they call insurance. Sorry to bore you all. Anyone out there with any advise.

I 1997 when oxycontin hit the market it was like a God send  but just as quick the scum of the earth found way to abuse this drug making it impossible for other to obtain what they needed to deal with their pain. I did get that worked out but after now 11years I feel it's been to long and I need to find a different direction. Yesterday for the first time I started the suboxone. It was the worst day of mt life! The Dr gave me 1/2 a tab to start and not much happened but about 1 1/2 hours later she gave me the second half and I want into full blown withdraw it was so horrible all I wanted was to die. She then sent me to drive home (15 miles alone)to start back on oxyconton. which did not help at all. I rolled on the floor in cramps| vomited| sweated inrivelets| cried and took even more oxycontin.

I just got cervical disk fusion and have several lumbar disks that are herniated. I have a sort of mixed review on this medication because it does not take away the pain but does something to my brain that let me tolerate the pain eventhough it is there and I can feel it. I don't want to increase the dosage as I been told that I won't totally get rid of all the pain. This medication has allowed me to get out of bed and function somewhat better but I cannot work on this medication.I am happy that I have a good doctor because the previous doctor to this one would only perscribe me percocet and I was taking 12 of those a day and they only bounced off the pain.I also have experienced the withdrawls which feel like the flu. I would rather be taking the med than not & I won;t go for any of those new meds because they will cause another organ in your body to fail. the only side affect with oxy is possible addiction. I have also tried opana 40 mg but need to take more to get relief but also work well without any funny feelings.

I had already been diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2000. So when I hurt my back  in '03 my body and back just ached. I tried to work until finally in '05 my back just gave out. I was bedridden until my 1st surgery. I thought great| I'll get better & get back to life and my job soon. THAT didn't happen. 6 mths later I was not even able to take care of myself. My legs just cramped so bad that when I tried to walk| I would just pass out. So after having a different surgeon do the 2nd surg. I saw a better difference. But still had alot of pain. Being in the bed for a year or so does terrible things to your body!! I underwent 2 years of therapy. My pain doc tried several different drugs like methadone and muscle relaxers along with a low dose of oxy. Didn't do much & my life was just going by me. I finally found a wonderful doc.HE IS THE BOMB!!He sincerely cares for his patients.He put me on Oxys and roxycontin. I'm on a dosage that has been adjusted to help my high pain level. Without  my meds the pain is about a 9.With meds my pain level is about a 6 or 7| which is very good for me. I'm on some other stuff too| but these 2 meds together r a great combo. It does make me mad when I hear about people   putting labels like ""druggie"" on chronic pain pts. Or people selling their meds| or worse...So| I try not to dwell on those ""looks"" u get or people talking crap| because I know they do. My advice is NEVER tell anyone what meds your on and keep them safe especially on vacation (i.e.Um|clean towels anyone)Need I say more? Or wherever u go. I keep mine locked up. Anyway I really like this medication. I can actually do things with my family now. I hope I've given some good advice to anyone going through this type situation.

Was told by having this surgery now it would lead to having my T sections of my spine fused and my neurosurgeon told me that I do not want to go fusing that area as it is a very severe surgery.

1309,1312, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) ,4,4,3,This drug works very well for arthritic/DDD pain| but there are side effects that can be extreme for some people.|Doctors are very concerned about prescribing it because the US Government prosecutes Doctors when patients abuse it| even if the patients lie to the Doctors - the Prosecutors say the Doctor should have known! (Dr. McIver got 30 years)|If you take it for any length of time there will be withdrawal symptoms if you miss a dose| and over time you will have to take an increasing dose because of tolerance. Doctors want you to take the same dose 2 times a day but I take it 3 times a day (every 8 hours) with last dose of 10mg 3 hours before bedtime so I can sleep 8 hours without withdrawal symptoms. Constipation is a problem| but mental problems will be worse.  After you take it you feel good (enrgetic| happy| stimulated) for the first 4 hours| but then you start feeling really bad - up to a black pit of fear in your stomach and thinking very negative thoughts - thinking about bad things that happened to you over and over| stories in the news will make you feel like crying| people will make you angry and won't understand your outbursts| and you will feel like shit and want to die. But then when you take the next pill you will feel good again. You just have to wait out the low parts and keep thinking that its not real that's the drug making you feel bad. Additionally taking an antidepressant helps some people with the low points| but some of them have side effects - different for each anti-depressant of fatigue or anxiety so you have to keep trying different anti-depressants until you find one that works for you.|Also you might want to hide your medication depending on who has access to your bathroom or wherever you store your pills.,OxyContin,35-44,Male

As time went on and anyone who has chronic pain knows that you build up a tolerance|and I am now on 80mg twice a day with 30mg Roxicodone for breakthrough pain-am I an addict? the answer is yes|and anyone who is on a daily regimine of narcotics is too-and if they say they are not they are lying!! This is all a part of being on addictive medicine|but my point is that this little pill gave me back my life-I was so used to taking a half hour to get out of bed-10min to get down the stairs-etc|etc...I can move freely and pretty much do anything antone else can except lift and move heavy things-but I thank Purdue Pharma for coming up with a drug that works|and helps people like myself to get back their lives!!!,OxyContin,35-44,Male

I was taken oxycontin 320 mg a day and 120 mg of oxycodone ir for about 6 plus years. My cousin stole my oxy while in hospital and reha for knee replcement and due to my family situation my mom kicked her out instead of calling the police. That was a mistake| I went to a few other doctors for pain medicine so I would not detox cold turkey. My doctor found out about it and cut me off except for thr morphine pump| which I would not recomend getting. After he found out about the other doctors he insisted I call the police| and I did even had proof she did it. He still cut me off my meds cold turkey and Ifelt like I was going to die. I now have no dr. because there are only 2 drs in this 200 mile radius who works with morphine pump. My quality of life is now the worst ever in my life| I lost everything including my wife. I am on disability since 1998. My dr. turned out to be 2 faced and I am sol. I sometimes feel like eing it all| plus doing other things that I cant say online. If a family member steals from you turn thm in asap| the doctors have a way of finding out that you received medicine from any doctor. HIPPA is not followed by the law. Don't end up suffering like me. Now I will have to move or go to Canada if possible. I have been in the most pain I have ever been in since my injury and brain sugery| plus knee replacement that mademy knee worse. Don't always trust your doctor either| ask for you medical records at least every 6 months to make sure they are right. I trusted mine for almost 8 years and now I am screwed.

1315,1318, Greg E.| 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) ,5,5,5,Oxycontin is a great medication for those of us that really need it. I had a double lumbar fusion (L4-S1) and then developed a dysfunctional left SI joint with increased radiculopathy and Sciatica. In other words| I NEED IT! The only thing I can say is to be careful and follow your doctors prescription orders to the letter! THIS MEDICATION CAN AND WILL KILL YOU IF YOU ABUSE IT BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU HIGH! I don't know if you have noticed| but there is a growing list of famous people with everything to live for| dropping dead over what they think will be a cheap thrill. For some of us| these drugs are the only choice to make it through life sometimes hour by hour because of the pain we deal with constantly. If you have a valid need for this medication| then hang in there and keep your medication secure. If you are just looking for a thrill| then go someplace else before you end up dead. All you will do is make it more difficult for those of us that genuinely need this medication harder and harder to get. No doctor wants to get blamed for writing a script that might kill a child or even adult. So all I am asking is to look somewhere else for your thrills. I started out this review by stating that Oxycontin is a great medication and I hope that everyone will act responsible so that it will still be there for us as long as we need it,OxyContin,35-44,Male

I have in some cases had forgotten my medication at home| let's say a day for example and the only problem I had was the fact that my pain would come and not subside until I had gotten to my medication. Although many people become addicted to it I personaly have not shown any sypmtoms of withdrawls when I did not have it. The only problem that would arrise was my chronic disc pain. I believe that this medicine is a god-send and should never be looked at as horrid substance (unless it is being abused by an addict). I would recomend it for people with severe continous pain problems and I have a great respect for the doctors whom believe in the use of it. I had a doctor whom diagnosed me and had perscibed me a medicine that did very little for my pain. When I had gotten a second opinion my new doctor was disgusted with my first doctor's diagnosis and evenchually put me on this medication.

My kidneys do not work and I am on peritoneal dialysis. So after about 2-3 months after starting this drug I began to have severe hallucinations| then started sleeping about 20 hours out of the day. Ended up in the ER and was considered as Overdosed due to so much of the drug building up in my system.||So if your on Peritoneal Dialysis be careful if you take this drug.

After 23 surgeries @ Shriner's Hospital from age 4-15| I was basically told by the Dr.'s ""this is the best we can do..enjoy your life as best you can."" At age 21| I was in a major car accident that almost cost me my right leg. Amazingly enough the Dr.'s ""saved"" it with 4 five inch plates & 18 screws that encircle what's left of my ankle. My back however| by miracle of God"" was not harmed. I am now 29| take 8 5/500 prescribed Vicodin a day|to be honest| sometimes more. About a year ago| a family member introduced me to Oxys. I have pain everyday in my back. My one shoulder blade ""pushes"" up against my neck causing unbearable pain| tingling| & numbness in my arm & hand. I also experience pain in the area of my spine that is kyphosis (hump) if I am to active or stand for too long. My leg ""bothers"" me moderately everyday| but when rain is on the way...I feel pressure as if someone is ""tightening up"" the screws. Oxy is amazing. I work a FT job still (somehow)| even though my family thinks I should be on disability. I've never had enough courage to ask my Dr for Oxy....even though it's the best pain medicine in existance. I take it on a regular basis| I'd rather not say how I get it. Vicodin is a great drug as well| but doesn't last for me longer than 2hrs. Oxy 20's & 10's last about 6 hrs| depending on what I'm up doing. I would say I am a ""functioning addict"". 2 or 3 days a month I am out of both meds. On these days| I am a walking corpse. I would advise people to be very careful w/these pain meds. Some may say I need rehab...but I don't take meds to ""get high""....I take 'em to function. If my ins was better| I could possibly have a back procedure to help lessen the pain. I am too scared to go thru a 24th spinal surgery as an adult. What kind of meds would ease my pain now after a surgery?!?!? The future is terrifying to me. Thank you all for reading. Take Oxy only if you REALLY NEED HELP.",OxyContin,25-34,Female

1437,1441, ktrygirl| 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,5,5,"I have been on this med for over 6 years| the only thing is having to change the dose|for my body grew a tolorence to it. I also take the IR too for breakthrough pain. I started at a very low dose and now I am at 60mg twice a day with the IR's 3 times a day. I have to take a prescriptive laxative daily| the side affects are bad if you miss doses and I know if I was to be dotoxed it would kill me| but I would rather not hurt and be able to do things in life than be bedridden forever. I also deal with Neuropathic Pain and Osteoarthritis. I know the morphine would possible do better but there are other meds I take that I cant take the morphine with so we have to use the Oxy| also use Lidoderm pain patches too. The pain is to the point that even with the meds| I will be getting a Comfort V-Lock Lumbar Spinal brace in a couple of weeks. My opinion is ""I would rather take the drugs than HURT every minute of the day""| I will deal with the side affects.",OxyContin,35-44,Female
1439,1443, cookie| 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) ,5,5,1,Dangerous| dangerous stuff. Almost killed me.  It was prescribed to help with the side effects of a 48 week treatment regimen of interferon for HCV. I was up around 400 milligrams a day between OxyContin and oxycodone.  I am an ex-heroin addict from the 70's and know all about withdrawals and detoxes| but nothing compares to the hell this stuff will put you through. It is a great pain reliever| but I believe from my own experiences| Methadone is as efficient| and though it is not easy to detox from either| it is not near the hell this stuff will put you through. I would avoid any and all contact with this drug as possible. Ask for any alternative.  I did beat HCV| but almost a year later I am on the maximum doses of Zoloft and Wellbutrin a day for depression.,OxyContin,45-54,Male

I have been taking this drug for about seven years and it works great for me. I have tried everything and this is the only one that helps me to be almost 100% of how I used to be.I am truly grateful to have this medication. It works so well that even though I have no insurance I continue to pay for it each month and it costs over $400.00 a month.But it works for me.,OxyContin,45-54,Female
